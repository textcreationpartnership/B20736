            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>6.</hi> That now very lately they gave in ſeven Propoſitions to be diſcuſſed, with promiſe of more. But neither of them was debated. Which wee alledge rather to vindicate our particular charge, then to blame men whoſe reaſons wee know not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7.</hi> With much adoe wee have preſented you with a <hi>fuller declaration of all our way, according to the Scriptures,</hi> in this learned, yet modeſt Treatiſe of <hi>THE WAY OF THE CHURCHES OF CHRIST IN NEVV-ENGLAND,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Written and ſent over by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Cotton.</hi> And wee doe in this Epiſtle certifie our aſſent thereunto, ſaving that wee doe not yet fully cloſe with ſome expreſsions <hi>paſſim</hi> in the Book, before ſome of which wee minded it to note a * in the
<pb facs="tcp:199168:2"/>Margin. This we could not but ſay and doe <hi>(pace tanti au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoris)</hi> or wee could not aſſert the Booke. If all things in this Treatiſe, as now printed, doe not anſwer punctually word for word, to the firſt written Copie, let the reverend Authour, and the candid Reader pardon us, becauſe wee had not the <hi>faireſt</hi> Copie, nor knew wee, till the Book was neer done, that there was a better to be had, nor to this day yet ever ſaw it.</p>
            <p>Therefore wee were forced to ſhift with this, ſo as to keep the mind of the Authour, make it <hi>conſtare ſibi,</hi> and by an <hi>interpretative</hi> leave in his abſence, not onely to doe as wee would be done by, but alſo as he himſelfe would have done (wee are confident) if he had been in our caſe, or preſent here.</p>
            <p>Leaſt any ſhould imagine, that every thing in the <hi>Keyes</hi> doth not fit all the <hi>wards</hi> in this Treatiſe to an haire, wee will here inſert <hi>Mr. Cottons</hi> own words, in his Letter coming from him in <hi>New-England</hi> to our hands in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nick of time, whiles this Epiſtle lay under the Preſſe; <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>If you think the Draught of ChuRCH-DISCIPLINE, which was ſent over in your Ship, varieth from that of the POVVER OF THE KEKES, ſent over the yeare after; you may have ſome occaſion ſo to conceive from ſome difference of expreſſion in LOGICALL TERMES, but not a jote in any DOCTRINE OF DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINITIE,</hi> or <hi>CHURCH-PRACTISE.</hi>

            <p>Diverſe Objections formerly laid againſt the Printing of this Book (to the ſadding of the Authour.) <hi>Some</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are now anſwered by the <hi>late ſeaſon of printing it.

               <hi>ſphere of the Authours judgement in this.</hi> Others, <hi>by that</hi> putting forth in print <hi>of an anſwer to this Book, before this was mid-wiſed by the Preſſe into the world. All reaſon therefore (now it can ſpeake) that it ſhould anſwer for it ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wee hope wee have ſatisfied the minde of the Authour as well as our owne; and of others too, of the other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; eſpecially of thoſe that call for</hi> fuller Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>root out of all our hearts the</hi> ſpirit of contradiction; <hi>that wee call not for Books, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, rather to</hi> confute <hi>them (as wee imagine) then to</hi> throw downe our ſelves humbly under the power of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wee are now fighting</hi> Modo militari, <hi>for reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let us not therefore fight</hi> againſt <hi>it</hi> more eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtico. <hi>With how much gravitie, ſoliditie, and modeſtie, have M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton, <hi>the</hi> Apologiſts, <hi>the</hi> Authours of 32. Queſtions, <hi>or</hi> Church Covenant, <hi>and other milde and judicious Authours written in our cauſe? But with what a different ſpirit have the adverſe part replyed; as if perſonall invectives, and imbittring a ſtile, were</hi> Gods <hi>way of bettering a cauſe, or battering an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here is a Booke ſo</hi> grave, and ſolid, <hi>that it cannot be juſtly deſpiſed by</hi> ingenuous learned men. <hi>So full of</hi> neceſſary caſes <hi>and truths, that it cannot but be deſired of thoſe that would be</hi> knowing men. <hi>And</hi> ſo milde and gentle, <hi>that it cannot but be cauſleſly quarrelled, if quarrelled by</hi> Cholerick men. <hi>Had wee not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it would prove a welcome Tract on</hi> all hands, <hi>for the reaſons afore-intimated, wee could with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the written Copie, well have ſaved this great travell. If it fall out otherwiſe, as it hath with diverſe
<pb facs="tcp:199168:3"/>of the like nature; Golden Lavers, or Veſſels made Common-ſhores and receptacles to be filled with all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy contempt; wee ſhall then clearly and fully decerne mens ſpirits, and deſcry their intents in challenging us for</hi> larger Narrations; <hi>and ſhall beware for time to come, how wee anger them with kindneſſes. But if this be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly entertained of them, then have they encouraged us in due time to impart (if God permit) a fuller Treatiſe of the ſame ſubject, with amplior demonſtrations, by joynt conſent of the Churches of</hi> Old and New-England: <hi>and meane while, they have abundantly recompenced the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love, of theirs in the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>For the joyning of faithfull Chriſtians into the fellowſhip and eſtate of a Church, we finde not in Scripture that God hath done it any other way then by entering all of them together, (as one man) into an holy Covenant with himſelfe, To take the Lord (as the head of his Church) for their God, and to give up themſelves to him, to be his Church and people; which implyeth their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of themſelves to him, and one to another in his feare; and their walking in profeſſed ſubjection to all his holy Ordinances: their cleaving one to another, as fellow-members of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in brotherly love and holy watchfulneſſe unto mutuall edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt Jeſus: For thus the Lord accepted and entered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:199168:5"/>family into Church eſtate, by receiving them and their children into ſuch a Covenant with himſelfe, though In generall termes, yet ſuch as imply the ſubſtance both of Chriſtians and Church duties, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. And after that when the poſteritie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had violated this Covenant in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Lord againe made another Covenant with them, whereby he took them to be a peculiar people unto himſelfe in the Wilderneſſe and Mount of <hi>Sinai,</hi> Exod. 19.1.5. Whence they were called the <hi>Church in the Wilderneſſe,</hi> Act. 7.38. And by reaſon of this Covenant, God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the whole body of that people as his owne Spouſe; <hi>I entered</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of that time) <hi>into a Covenant with thee; and thou becameſt mine,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. Moreover, the next generation after them, he eſtabliſhed them to be his Church and people, by entring them againe into a Covenant, according to the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> Deut. 29.10. to 13. By vertue of which Covenant, as well as by the former, they were joyned, not onely to the Lord, and to the Officers (the Prieſts and Levites) which he had given them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.19. but alſo to mutuall watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe over one another, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.18. In ſo much that through their neglect thereof, the ſinne of one <hi>Achan,</hi> was the ſinne of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Joſh. 7.11.</p>
                     <p>Which kinde of Covenanting with God, we finde diverſly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated in Scripture, and every way ſufficient for the conſtituting of a godly ſociety or company to become a Church unto God: Sometimes God, or his Meſſengers in his ſtead, propoundeth and giveth a Covenant unto a people, and they accept it, though not in expreſſe words, yet by ſilent conſent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10. to the end of <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.

In ſome we account it all one, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199168:6"/>of like value, when a Covenant of God is propounded and given on Gods part to a people, whether they receive it by ſilent conſent, or by expreſſe termes, either by word of mouth, or by writing and ſeale, and whether their cleaving to their Brethren and Officers, and mutuall watchfulneſſe over one another, be expreſly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or included onely in their generall profeſſion of ſubjection to all Gods holy Ordinances and Covenant; For we ſee it evident by comparing the former Scriptures, that by any one of theſe wayes a people is received and eſtabliſhed to be a peculiar people and Church unto the Lord, and each of them lay hold of the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall priviledges, and hold forth the ſame holy duties.</p>
                     <p>Neither is there any colour to conceive this way of entring into Church eſtate by Covenant, to be peculiar to the Paedagogy of the old Teſtament; for it is evident by the light of nature, that all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Relations are founded in Covenant. For, to paſſe by naturall Relations between Parents and Children, and violent Relations between Conquerours and Captives; there is no other way given whereby a people (<hi>ſui Juris</hi>) free from naturall and compulſory engagements, can be united or combined together into one viſible body, to ſtand by mutuall Relation, fellow-members of the ſame body, but onely by mutuall Covenant; as appeareth between huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife in the family, Magiſtrates and ſubjects in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, fellow Citizens in the ſame Citie: and therefore in the New Teſtament, when a people whom the Apoſtles by their miniſtery had converted, were to be gathered by them into a Church eſtate, what did the Apoſtles elſe but combine them into one body, as one chaſte Virgin and Spouſe unto Chriſt? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. And how could that (not univerſall, but particular) Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> be offered up in one body, not as many Spouſes, as all the particular members of that Church were by their converſion, but as one Spouſe unto-Chriſt, but onely by joyning all together in one Covenant, or Eſpouſage, to worſhip the Lord Jeſus, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the Ordinances of his houſe?</p>

                  <p>Now becauſe (through the grace of Chriſt) our Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are nurſing Fathers to the Church, and the Churches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready eſtabliſhed, are carried not onely with a pious deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the kingdome of Chriſt, but alſo with brotherly love to ſuch as intend ſo good a worke; thoſe Chriſtians therefore that deſire to enter into Church-fellowſhip together, doe acquaint the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and ſome of the neereſt Magiſtrates, and thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which are next adjoyning to them, with their intentions to enter into Church-fellowſhip, and crave the preſence of ſome from amongſt them (at the day appointed, ſome few weeks after) to helpe them with their prayers, and with their counſell, (if need ſhould be) in ſo weightie a buſineſſe, as being themſelves for the moſt part, leſſe experienced in the wayes of Chriſts Kingdome, then thoſe who have gone before them in ſuch a worke; as alſo deſiring to approve themſelves and their courſe, to the conſciences of the Brethren of other Churches, that they may more freely give them the right hand of fellowſhip, and ſo receive them to all Brotherly communion in the Lord, amongſt the reſt of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and this agreeth with the laſt part of the fift Propoſition.</p>

                  <p>This done with the ſilent approbation of the whole Aſſembly, he propoundeth the Covenant of promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. denying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo any ſufficiency in themſelves to keepe Covenant with God, (as having been tranſgreſſors from their youth up) they profeſſe in the name of Chriſt their acceptance of the Lord for their God, and the Lord Jeſus (the head and Saviour of his Church) to be their King, Prieſt, and Prophet; and give up themſelves in profeſſed ſubjection unto all his holy Ordinances, according to the Rules of the Goſpel; withall they profeſſe their full purpoſe of heart, to cleave one to another in Brotherly love, and mutuall ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to God; not forſaking their Aſſembly, (but as the Lord ſhall call) and miniſtring one to another (as becometh good Stewards of the manifold graces of God) till they all grow up to a perfect man in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

Though Office be one thing, and gift to diſcharge an office another, and the actions or exerciſe of every ſeverall gift doth not alwayes argue a ſeverall office; yet in this place it is the ſcope of the Apoſtle to expreſſe the different offices, or functions of Paſtors and Teachers by their different and proper acts; for here he ſpeaketh of the divers members of the Church, as of divers members of the naturall body, who having divers offices, or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the body, are to performe different proper actions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different functions; <hi>as wee having many members</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in one body</hi> (ver. 4, 5.) <hi>and all the members have not one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> (as the tranſlator turneth it when the Originall ſaith, have not one action, or practiſe, but both expreſſing the ſame meaning;)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199168:10"/>
                     <hi>ſo wee being many are one body in Chriſt, and every one members one of another, having then</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.) <hi>different gifts</hi> (gifts compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending both offices and grace) <hi>whether Prophecy, let us prophecy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of faith, or miniſtery, let us waite on our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, whether he that teacheth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi> And looke then, as in the naturall body, it being the action of the tongue to ſpeake, it is his function and office to ſpeak, and not to ſee: and it being the action of the eye to ſee, it is his function to ſee, and not to heare; So it is in the members of the body of Chriſt, it being the action of the teacher to teach, he is to attend unto teaching, not unto exhortation; and it being the action of the Paſtor or Exhortor to exhort, he is to attend on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, not on teaching.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. If the Apoſtle ſpeake here onely of ſeverall actions or exerciſes of ſeverall gifts, but both co-incident to the ſame perſon and officer in the Church; why then doth he command the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to waite on teaching? and the Exhorter to waite on exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? for he that performeth an action according to this gift, which is not peculiar to his office, but common to him with men of other offices, is never commanded, nor is it his dutie to attend or waite on ſuch an action. As if a man have a gift of love, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or liberalitie, and according to that gift be fit to performe an action of giving Almes, yet he is not commanded to attend or waite upon Almeſgiving, unleſſe it be his office as well as his gift?</p>

Neither may it be thought, as ſome have done, that the benefit of Chriſtian Magiſtracy taketh off the neceſſitie of Church-Government: For the government of the Church, is as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt is, not of this world, but ſpirituall and heavenly. The power of the keys is far diſtant from the power of the ſword, and though one of them may need the helpe of the other, when they goe aſtray, yet when they are rightly ordered, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, the one of them doth not intercept, but eſtabliſh the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other.</p>
                  <p>A third witneſſe to the office of ruling Elders in the Church, is that well knowne and much agitated Text in <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>The Elders who rule well, are worthy of double honour; eſpecially they who labour in Word and Doctrine.</hi> This text, though it have been much vext and rackt to looke and ſpeake another way; yet when all is done, it ſtill giveth a cleare and ſtedfaſt evidence to this office. The moſt learned Adverſaries of this Ordinance would faſten foure other interpretations of the place, and each of them (as they pretend) more pertinent to the ſcope and ſenſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words, then this of ruling Elders.</p>
                  <q>1. Say they, by ruling Elders may be meant Deacons; for the Apoſtle giving <hi>Timothy</hi> to underſtand, what manner of perſons they be, with whoſe maintenance the Church is to be charged, having before informed him of widowes, now telleth him the Deacons alſo are to be maintained, yea, and with a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above them; and either the Deacons are not to be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at all at the Churches charge, or elſe the Apoſtle provideth for their maintenance in this place, or no where.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is no man to be maintained at the Churches charges, but either in reſpect of his preſent poverty and neceſſity, or in reſpect of his office, which calleth him off from the attendance to the maintenance of his private family unto the publike ſervice of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:199168:14"/>the Church. In the former caſe, if it fall out that the Deacons be in neceſſity, they may be ſupplied with ſome maintenance from the Church, as well as any other of the poore brethren; and ſo, though this Text ſayth nothing concerning them, yet other Scriptures take care for them: for the Deacons, by the very inſtitution of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, were to take up the function which the Apoſtles laid downe (as over troubleſome, and incompatible to their Miniſteriall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,) now that which they laid down, was the ſerving of tables, and diſtributing to every brother according to his need, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2. with 4.35. if then their own need require, they may with the Churches allowance, take themſelves of that ſupply which they diſpoſe to others. But in reſpect of their office, there is little cauſe they ſhould expect maintenance from the Churches charge; for their office takes them very little off from attendance to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their own family. Seeing by the Ordinance of Chriſt they ſpend no time to go in and out to collect monies, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what is brought to them, as an oblation to the Lord, laid down before them every Lords day in the face of the Church, or elſe what is brought home to their own houſes, according to the bills they put in on the Lords day; and look what time they may ſpend in keeping a juſt accompt of what they lay out, or in viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſick or poore brethren, their time and labour ſpent herein is ſufficiently recompenced by the uſe of the Churches ſtock, or treaſury lying in their hands. Secondly, beſides, this Text calleth for maintenance to thoſe Elders in reſpect of their office of ruling well, but neither are Deacons ſtiled Elders in any place of Scripture, neither is their office a place of rule, but of ſervice to Tables; ſo that this Text will by no force be racked to bear this interpretation.</p>

                  <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and laſt interpretation of theſe words in <hi>Timothy</hi> (which wee ſee taketh with the moſt judicious amongſt the adverſaries of this Ordinance) is, that here not two ſorts of Elders, but two parts of the office of preaching Elders are ſet forth: The one, good life and good government; and the other, good doctrine and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe therein; and this latter preferred before the other, as more worthy of due honour and recompence.</p>
                  <p>Now for anſwer hereunto, it may be conſidered, that good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, either of a mans life, or of the people, or as the Apoſtles words be, <hi>their ruling well,</hi> may either be taken properly and ſtrictly, as <hi>rule</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>miniſtery</hi> of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; or more largely for the whole office of a good Elder, <hi>Bene praeeſſe,</hi> to be a good preſident. If to <hi>rule well,</hi> be taken in the former ſenſe properly, then it acknowledgeth Elders that attend to <hi>rule,</hi> to be worthy of double honour, without reſpect to their labour, in the <hi>miniſtery</hi> of the Word, which is the ſenſe of the place that wee build upon; for if it ſhould be ſaid, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Miniſters or Preachers, that they <hi>ruling well, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double honour,</hi> though they doe not labour in Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; the wiſer ſorts of oppoſites doe diſcerne that would not ſuite with the Apoſtles minde, who would be ſo far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>well ruling,</hi> but not <hi>painfull preaching Miniſters</hi> ſhould be worthy of double honour, that he would account them worthy of little or no honour at all. And they fitly quote for this purpoſe, the place before alledged, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. where when the Apoſtle calleth for <hi>ſingular love, and honour to their overſeers, for their works ſake,</hi> he putteth in there, <hi>Labouring amongst them</hi> (to wit, in the Word) without w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> no ſuch reſpect were due to them. <q rend="inline">They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take the Apoſtles words in the latter ſenſe; underſtanding by <hi>well ruling,</hi> the whole office, even all the duties of good preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, the <hi>Elders that rule well,</hi> that is, who are <hi>good rulers,</hi> and preſidents, <hi>They are worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> chiefly they who labour in preaching the Word. And they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199168:16"/>give for example this inſtance: <hi>Logicians,</hi> who <hi>reaſon well,</hi> that is, all good Logicians, are to be honoured, eſpecially thoſe who <hi>judge</hi> well, or are judicious; where, not two ſorts of Logicians are held forth, but two duties or faculties of all Logicians, in reſpect of which they are to be honoured; the one generall to <hi>reaſon well,</hi> the other ſpeciall to <hi>judge well;</hi> and theſe diſpoſed, not in a diſtribution, but in a comparative ſentence, preferring the later before the former.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But neither will this ſenſe ſtand with the Apoſtles words and meaning: for hereupon this abſurdity would follow, that if <hi>well-ruling</hi> in the former part of the ſentence, held forth generally all the duties of good Miniſters, and <hi>labouring in word and doctrine,</hi> (in the later part) one ſpeciall part of their office, then the other, good Miniſters, for doing all. Neither doth the inſtance given of <hi>Logicians</hi> help: for it may be truly ſaid of <hi>Logicians;</hi> that <hi>Logicians</hi> who <hi>reaſon well,</hi> that is, all good <hi>Logicians,</hi> are worthy of honour, eſpecially they who are judicious, becauſe, if they only reaſon well in invention, though they be not judicious, yet ſuch alſo are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. But it's not truly ſaid of Miniſters, that if they rule well, that is, do their office well in Diſcipline and <hi>Rule,</hi> though they <hi>labour not in word and Doctrine,</hi> that they are commendable; but otherwiſe, if <hi>Logicians,</hi> be good as well in <hi>judgement</hi> as in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> and ſo perform both the parts of their art well; it may be ſaid indeed, that they are commendable and honourable, but it cannot be ſaid without abſurdity, that ſuch as are <hi>judicious</hi> are more commendable, or chiefly to be honoured above thoſe that are both <hi>ingenuous</hi> and <hi>judicious,</hi> both parts are doubtleſſe better then either alone: neither will the abſurdity be helped by ſaying <hi>Logicians</hi> that <hi>reaſon well,</hi> both in <hi>invention</hi> and in <hi>judgement,</hi> are worthy of honour, or double honour, eſpecially they that excell in judgement; for though ſpeech be rationall, yet the like cannot be applied in this Text: for it is not ſaid in the Text, <hi>the Elders that rule well are worthy of double honour, eſpecially they that excell in preaching,</hi> which labour doth not hold forth excellency (as hath been ſhewed before, but only poſitively and ſimply <hi>pains taking,</hi> in preaching, the common act and work of all good Miniſters, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. The iſſue of all is, that when men of learning and judgement have wearied their wits and ſtrength, to ſhoulder out <hi>ruling Elders,</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:199168:16"/>from this Text, yet ſuch is the evidence and wiſdome of the holy Ghoſt, in the word, that it may well appeare, the weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then men, and the fooliſhneſſe of God wiſer then men; the words cannot but approve two ſorts of Elders, and both worthy of double honour, both they that <hi>rule well,</hi> though they labour not in preaching, and eſpecially they that do <hi>labour in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but this interpretation will by no means ſatisfie ſome of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary judgement, for three reaſons, to ſpeak nothing of the fourth, the pretended probability of other interpretations, which have been refuted already.</p>
                  <q>Firſt ſay they, the Text it ſelf clearly renounceth non-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders; for both ſorts of Elders ſpoken of, are expreſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the Text to be worthy of double honour, that is, not reverence only, but maintenance at the charge of the Church; but that non-preaching Elders ſhould by Gods inſtitution have received maintenance at the Churches hand, is a thing ſo ſtrange, and unheard of, that untill I ſee it juſtly proved, (ſaith <hi>B.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very true, the Apoſtle by double honour, doth not mean reverence only, but maintenance; But why ſhould it ſeem ſo ſtrange a thing, and unheard of, that ruling Elders, though not Preachers, ſhould partake in maintenance from the Churches treaſury? do you think ſuch men ſpeake in good earneſt, when they ſo ſpeak? Whence have the Chancellors, Commiſſaries, and Officialls their maintenance, but from the Church? and do they labour in word and doctrine? are not moſt of them Civilians? and if we may uſe the word without offence, meer Lay-men? but our ruling Elders, wee utterly deny them to be Lay-men as the word is commonly meant in this controverſie; but Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſet apart to their office by the election of the people, and by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands: but if they were Lay-men (which they are not) yet you ſee it is no ſtrange or unheard of matter, that Churches ſhould be bountifull to the maintenance of ſundry ſorts of Church Rulers, who are meerly Lay-men, as their adverſaries miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe to be; yea, what were the many Cloyſters of Munks, and Friers and Nuns, in the times of Popery? were they Preachers of the Word? were they not Lay-men &amp; women? and yet did the Churches of thoſe times grudge them their maintenance upon pretence of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199168:17"/>their laity? But the world will love his own; be there never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idle Droans, or ſtately Rulers of mans own deviſing, the Church muſt ſupply them not only with maintenance, but with magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; but let the Lord appoint <hi>ruling Elders,</hi> according to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, to aſſiſt his Miniſters in the work of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that they might attend the more to labour in the Word, if they ſhall expect from the Church any maintenance for their works ſake, Oh! that ſeemeth a ſtrange matter, and unheard of from all antiquity, till this preſent age.</p>
                  <q>The ſecond Reaſon why lay Elders, (as they miſcall them <hi>ruling Elders</hi> (as we with <hi>Paul</hi> call them) are not meant in <hi>Pauls</hi> Text, is becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> mentioning the Presbyters but once in all his Epiſtles, excludeth all lay Elders from that Presbytery, <hi>Neglect not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the grace which is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with impoſitions by the hands of the Presbyterie,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.14.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The words of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> do plainly imply, not only that <hi>conſulting with Elders</hi> was grown out of uſe, but that the <hi>Elders</hi> themſelves, who were wont to be conſulted with, were grown out of uſe alſo: for his words be, <hi>the Synagogue, and afterwards the Church had Elders, without whoſe counſell nothing was done in the Church,</hi> &amp;c. which plainly intimateth, the Church formerly had ſuch, but then hath them not, they are obſolete, and accordingly conſulting with them is obſolete alſo. 2. It is plain theſe <hi>Elders</hi> are oppoſite to <hi>Doctors</hi> or <hi>Teachers,</hi> or (if you will ſo conſtrue them) learned men, and therefore theſe <hi>Elders</hi> were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Doctors</hi> nor <hi>Teachers,</hi> nor Learned men. But to appropriate the name of <hi>Doctors</hi> or <hi>Teachers,</hi> or <hi>Learned men</hi> to <hi>Biſhops</hi> only, were too great an arrogancy in <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and too great an injury to the <hi>learned Paſtors and Teachers</hi> in every age, till <hi>Antichriſt</hi> his darkneſſe overwhelmed all in ignorance, as well <hi>Biſhops</hi> as <hi>Paſtors.</hi> 3. It may be marvelled, why thoſe learned oppoſites, that make this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſhould underſtand <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to attribute it to the idleneſſe of the Teachers, that for their own eaſe they gave over meddling in matters appertaining to government, when as rather it was the Biſhops and their parties idleneſſe, that they gave over labouring in Word and Doctrine, and their pride, that they ingroſſed all rule and government into their own hands; and therefore, when they ſay, they cannot ſee how the excluding of <hi>Seniors,</hi> and the taking of the whole burthen of government upon themſelves, could by <hi>Ambroſe</hi> be imputed as a matter of ſloth and idleneſſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Biſhops;</hi> ſurely, if men do not willingly ſhut their eyes, they may ſee, and daily experience maketh it palpably evident, that they who are moſt idle in teaching, are moſt buſie and proud in government; ſo that the <hi>Doctorum deſidia, aut magis ſuperbia,</hi> which <hi>Ambroſe</hi> maketh to be the two cauſes why <hi>Seniors</hi> in the Church, and conſulting with them, were then both of them grown out of uſe, need no Comment to expound the ſame, but the perpetuall practice of thoſe perſons, who have from the former ages, to this very day, uſurped all Church-government into their own hands.</p>
                  <p>If any man ſay (as ſome have done) that whatſoever this <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſaith, yet that famous Biſhop <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth utterly diſclaim it, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Valentinian,</hi> that any <hi>lay Ruler ſhould be Judge of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:199168:19"/>Church-offices and cauſes;</hi> let him take for an anſwer that which hath been often given; that we utterly deny thoſe <hi>ruling Elders</hi> to be <hi>Lay-men,</hi> or <hi>lay Judges,</hi> but part of that Church body which thoſe ancient times called <hi>Clerus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid againe (as alſo it is) that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calleth his <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Antiſtites,</hi> and <hi>Vicars of God,</hi> and ſuch like ſtiles of high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, let them underſtand, that the leaſt office of rule in the Church of God, (to a ſpirituall eye) will eaſily and ſafely admit as great acknowledgements as theſe be; onely to fleſh and blood nothing ſeemeth divine and high but ſecular pompe and worldly glory.</p>
                  <p>Having thus reſcued the Teſtimony of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> unto <hi>Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> from all Exceptions (of any colourable weight) made againſt it; Let us adde onely one obſervation out of Antiquitie, which may give ſome further light to the cauſe in hand. It is well known to all ſuch as are ſtudious of Antiquitie, that it was counted a rare and inſolent matter for an <hi>Elder</hi> to preach in the preſence of a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> which was the cauſe why the good old Biſhop <hi>Valerius</hi> was hardly ſpoken of, for ſuffering <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> a <hi>Presbyter</hi> (though a learned <hi>Presbyter</hi>) to preach before him; which is ſaid never any <hi>African</hi> Biſhop had allowed before him. Now whence ſhould ſuch an offence as was taken againſt <hi>Valerius</hi> ariſe, but from tranſlating the ſilence of <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> from Preaching in the preſence of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> unto thoſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> alſo, who were called oft to preach the Word freely and diligently as well as the Biſhops themſelves? But when through corruption of times, <hi>Biſhops</hi> clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to themſelves the principall <hi>paſtorall</hi> cure of Soules, then it was taken for an offenſive matter, that <hi>Teaching Elders</hi> ſhould preach before them; as before it was unwonted for <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> to preach before the <hi>Teaching</hi> ordinarily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But there remaines one objection or two, which ſome learned and prudent men have made againſt the office of <hi>Ruling Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. It is not credible that the office of <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> ſhould be of Divine or Apoſtolicall Inſtitution, and no footſteps left of it in any Church of Chriſt, for theſe many hundred yeares. Popery it ſelfe, though it corrupted all Ordinances, yet retaineth ſome footſteps of every Ordinance of Chriſt, though much perverted
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:199168:20"/>from the firſt Inſtitution: But there are no footſteps at all of thoſe <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> extant, in any Church, but thoſe of <hi>Genevah,</hi> and ſuch as have followed their patterne. For though ſome tell us of <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> and <hi>Veſtry men</hi> in the <hi>Pariſh Churches of England,</hi> who aſſiſt the Preachers in the governing of the Church, yet there is a great difference between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>Ruling Elders;</hi> For theſe <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> and <hi>Veſtry men,</hi> are appointed not for aſſiſtance to the Miniſters in governing the Church, but for other purpoſes: As <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> for keeping the Churches ſtock, and laying it out upon neceſſary repaires of the place of Gods Worſhip, (called the Church) and the <hi>Veſtry</hi> being a company of the wiſeſt and richeſt Pariſhioners, that have been, or are to be <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> are exerciſed in auditing the accompts of the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> and <hi>Collectors for the poore.</hi> And though now and then they are taken up in admoniſhing an unruly neighbour, yet they doe it not by <hi>Authoritie,</hi> as <hi>Rulers,</hi> but by <hi>Chriſtian diſcretion and charitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee doe not ſay, that <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> and <hi>Veſtry men,</hi> are the <hi>ſame</hi> with <hi>Ruling Elders;</hi> for though they are both choſe by the body of the Church, yet in the choice, the <hi>qualifications</hi> of <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> are not attended to; nor are they ſo <hi>ordained,</hi> either with the like holy <hi>Solemnitie,</hi> or <hi>inveſted</hi> with the ſame meaſure of <hi>ſpirituall power,</hi> nor allowed to <hi>continue for life,</hi> as <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> are, and ought to be; But yet ſuch as they be, wee may ſee in them ſome footſteps and remnants, (and as it were <hi>Rudera</hi>) of that holy and ancient Ordinance, ſo much as is eſcaped out of the ruines of Antichriſtian Apoſtaſie: For to ſay nothing of <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Commiſſaries,</hi> and <hi>Officialls,</hi> (who are meere <hi>Lay Elders,</hi> and yet adminiſter Church-Government, not in one Church onely, but in many ſcores of Churches,) what other thing ſoundeth the very name of <hi>Church-Wardens, Guardiani Eccleſiae,</hi> but <hi>Church-Guardians,</hi> or <hi>Church-Rulers?</hi> And what is the company of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrymen,</hi> but a kinde of a <hi>Conſiſtory?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though by the Sophiſtry of Satan and of his Vicar (the man of ſin) a great part of this care is transformed from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>ſpirituall body of the Church,</hi> to take care of the body of the <hi>materiall Church</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi> yet what power of Government is left in any Congregation (beſides Preaching the Word) the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:199168:20"/>
                     <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> and <hi>Veſtery men</hi> doe aſſiſt the <hi>Miniſters</hi> in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ſame: they obſerve all ſcandalous diſorders, that are found in any of the Church-Miniſters or people, they admoniſh the offenders: And though they be over-rulers to preſent all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders to the <hi>Cathedrall Church</hi> (and the Officers thereof) which of right they ſhould complaine of (when the offenders are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible) onely to their own Congregation, yet it is an uſuall thing for the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and his Officers, to returne ſuch offenders (having firſt paid them their fees) to the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> to make acknowledgement of their offences before them, and to profeſſe their amendment, of which alſo they muſt bring a <hi>Certificate</hi> under the <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> hands. Yea, (of our knowledge) there be ſome peculiar priviledged Churches in <hi>England,</hi> exempted from the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and his <hi>Officers,</hi> where the <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or with the conſent of the Congregation, doe tranſact all that Government, which in other Churches the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and his <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers</hi> doe invade and uſurpe; as to admoniſh offenders, to enjoyne acknowledgement of ſcandalous offences, and to debarre from the Sacraments, &amp;c. And by this means they repreſſe idleneſſe, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe, ſwearing, Sabbath-breaking, and the like diſorders, with better ſucceſſe then other Townes can doe; who have the helpe of Major and Juſtices, but not ſo much ſpirituall power in the Church: but by that power which is ſtill left in ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches unto their <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Guardians,</hi> (or <hi>Rulers</hi>) it may not obſcurely appeare, that anciently they did enjoy it amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, before one Church began to Lord it over another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The other Objection which is made againſt <hi>Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> is, That it is a matter of perilous conſequence to ſet up <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> in the Church, and that by Authoritie from the Word of God, when yet the Word hath no where ſet forth the limits and bounds of their Authoritie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The word of God hath clearly enough limited the bounds of a <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> Calling, and the worke of his Rule: For ſince all <hi>Eccleſiaſticall power,</hi> is the power of the <hi>keyes;</hi> (not of the Sword, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19.) And, <hi>the Kingdome of Chriſt is not of this world,</hi> Joh. 18.36. It is plaine, no Church-Governour may take up the <hi>power of the ſword,</hi> to wit, <hi>Civill Juriſdiction,</hi> without
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:199168:21"/>uſurpation; The power of the ſword is <hi>Princely, Lordly;</hi> But the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> is onely <hi>Stewardly</hi> and <hi>Miniſteriall;</hi> For ſo it is ſaid, the <hi>Keys of the Houſe of David to Eliakim,</hi> Iſa. 22.22. And, <hi>he was over the Houſe,</hi> Ver. 15. Which phraſe of <hi>being over the Houſe,</hi> is tranſlated properly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.19. <hi>Steward of the Houſe.</hi> Seeing then the Kingdome of Chriſt is <hi>ſpiritnall,</hi> and not <hi>worldly,</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> of his Kingdome is not <hi>Lordly,</hi> but <hi>Stewardly</hi> and <hi>Miniſteriall,</hi> evident it is that theſe <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> in the Church, may onely attend to works of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>miniſteriall Rule:</hi> And further, becauſe ſuch acts of <hi>ſpirituall Rule,</hi> as are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced in the <hi>preaching of the Word,</hi> the <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to attend unto, but that worke is left unto <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> Therefore plaine it is, that what acts ſoever of <hi>ſpirituall Rule</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> Chriſt hath committed to his Church over and above the <hi>Miniſtery of the Word and Sacraments:</hi> All ſuch acts of <hi>Rule</hi> are committed to the <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> and none but ſuch.</p>
                  <p>To Inſtance then in the particular duties of the <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> Office: The <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> having received the keys of Chriſts Houſe, as his <hi>Stewards;</hi> it doth belong to their Power.</p>
                  <p>1. To <hi>open and ſhut the doores of Chriſts Houſe or Church;</hi> that is, to admit and receive all members and Officers into place in the Church, (with the conſent of the Church) and to keepe out the unworthy: Hence Miniſters are ſaid to be ordained and admitted into office by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. And if Miniſters be admitted through their hands into of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Church, how much more private members after due tryall.</p>
                  <p>2. If they have power to open the doores of the Church, by admitting officers and other members into the Church, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the unworthy, (ſhutting the doores againſt them) Then they have alſo power (with the conſent of the Church, and their fellow-<hi>Elders,</hi> as in the former) to <hi>caſt out of the Church by Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> ſuch as fall into ſcandalous offences within the Church, and doe perſiſt therein; For <hi>Ejuſdem poreſtatis eſt deſtituere, cujus eſt inſtituere,</hi> The ſame keys that have power to open the doores, have power to ſhut it.</p>
                  <p>3. As it is the office of a <hi>Steward</hi> in a family, ſo it is of the <hi>Elders</hi> in the Church, To ſee that none live Inordinately, without a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

                  <p>4. As a <hi>Steward</hi> in the family is not to ſuffer any members in the family to hinder his fellows in his Lords work, ſo neither ought the <hi>Ruling Elder</hi> to ſuffer any to walke ſcandalouſly in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; for that hindereth edification, which is the worke that each one in his place is to ſet forward in the houſe of God: And the Church-Rulers are to attend to ſee it done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>5. It is the <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> office to prepare matters for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as much as may be, to prevent their trouble, by keeping out ſuch complaints, and other matters, as are not yet ripe for the Churches cognizance; And by ordering ſuch things as are to be preſented to them; <hi>Paul</hi> conſulteth with the <hi>Elders</hi> as well as with the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> before he preſented himſelfe to the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.18. to 24.</p>
                  <p>6. It belongeth to the <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> (as well as to the <hi>Teachers</hi>) to moderate the carriage of all matters in the Congregation Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, as to call on Strangers of other Churches or members to ſpeak upon occaſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15.

                  <p>8. It is a part of their office (though it be not theirs alone) to viſit the ſick, (eſpecially when they are ſent for) and together with ſome counſell and admonition to pray for them, and to helpe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their ſpirituall eſtate; as <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15, 16.</p>

                  <p>When therefore any of the Churches are deſtitute of any of theſe Officers, the Brethren of the Church (according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles advice, in defect of <hi>Deacons,</hi> and ſo in defect of all other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers) <hi>they look out from amongst themſelves,</hi> ſuch perſons as are in ſome meaſure qualified according to the direction of the Word; <hi>Elders</hi> according to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. to 7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.6. to 9. <hi>Deacons</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. to 12. For the Church hath not <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute</hi> power to chooſe whom they liſt, but <hi>miniſteriall</hi> power onely, to chooſe whom Chriſt hath choſen, hath gifted and fitted for them. If the Church can finde out none ſuch in their own body, they ſend to any other Church for fit ſupply, and each Church looketh at it as their dutie to be mutually helpfull one to another, in yeelding what ſupply they may, without too much prejudice to themſelves, according to <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8, 9. Such being recommended to them for ſuch a work, they take ſome time of tryall of them, partly by their owne obſervation and communion with them, partly by conſultation with the <hi>Elders</hi> of other Churches (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing there) in ſo great a work; to fulfill the command of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.22.

Of this they give notice to all the neare adjoyning Churches, whom, and when, and to what office they intend to chooſe ſuch a man, whom they nominate to them, intreating their preſence, and brotherly counſell, and aſſiſtance at the day appointed: They give notice alſo thereof unto the Governour, and ſuch other of the Magiſtrates, as are near to them, that the perſon to be choſen meeting with no juſt exception from any, may finde the greater incouragement and acceptance from all.</p>

                  <p>Towards the end of the day, one of the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church (if they have any) if not, one of the graver Brethren of the Church, (appointed by themſelves to order the worke of the day) ſtandeth up and inquireth of the Church, <q rend="inline">If now after this ſolemne ſeeking of God for his counſell and direction in this weightie work, they ſtill continue in their purpoſe, to elect ſuch a one for their own <hi>Paſtor,</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> or <hi>Ruling Elder,</hi> whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they agreed upon;</q> Then having taken their ſilence for a conſent to their purpoſe.

Now ſeeing all is clear for their free election of him to ſuch an office, he deſireth all the Brethren of that Church, to declare their Election of him with one accord, by lifting up their hands; which being done, he deſireth to know of the partie choſen, whether he doth accept of that calling, which the Church hath given him in the name of Chriſt unto that office? He having expreſſed his acceptance (upon ſuch grounds, as wherein he hath chiefly ſeene the hand of God leading him thereunto,) the <hi>Elder</hi> doth then admoniſh the Church what duties the Lord requireth of them all in his Word towards him, whom they have thus cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; And afterwards advertiſeth him what duties the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of him in that place towards the Church; And having taken the acknowledgements of them both, of their mutuall dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another; He then with the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of that Church (if they have any, if not two or three others of the graveſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians amongſt the Brethren of that Church, being deputed by the body) <q rend="inline">doe in the name of the Lord Jeſus ordaine him unto that Office, with impoſition of hands, calling upon the Lord, (who hath furniſhed him with ſpirituall gifts, and bowed the hearts of the Church to call him to that office) to accept and owne him therein, to enlarge his heart and ſpirit, according to all the duties thereof, to breath in all his adminiſtrations, and to guide and bleſſe all his going out and coming in before them:</q> And ſo turning his ſpeech upon the perſon on whom their hands are impoſed, <q rend="inline">He as the mouth of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> expreſſeth their ordination of him to that office in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and puts a ſolemne charge upon him to looke well to himſelfe, and to the whole flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made him an overſeer, as one that muſt give account of all their ſoules unto the great Shepheard of the ſheep, at the day of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q> After this the <hi>Elders</hi> of their Churches preſent, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the preſence of God, both in the duties of that day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Officer then choſen, and ordained, and in the orderly proceeding of the Church to his <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> one of them in the name of all the reſt, doth give unto him the <hi>right hand of fellowſhip,</hi> in the ſight of all the Aſſembly, teſtifying their Brotherly acceptance of him, and their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God for his gracious gift beſtowed on him, and doth

Though the <hi>office</hi> of a <hi>Paſtor</hi> in generall be immediately from Chriſt, and the authoritie from him alſo, yet the <hi>application</hi> of this office, and of this authoritie to this elect perſon, is by the Church; and therefore the Church hath ſufficient and juſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as to elect and call a <hi>Presbyter</hi> unto office, ſo to ordaine him to it, by impoſition of hands: They that have Power to elect a King, have power alſo to depute ſome in their name to ſet the Crowne upon his head.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. As the Authoritie of the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and other <hi>Elders,</hi> is not from the Church, but from Chriſt; ſo neither is their Office and Authoritie from the Biſhop, nor from the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> nor from the <hi>Claſſis of Presbyteries;</hi> If therefore that were a juſt impediment, why the Church ſhould not lay hands upon their elect <hi>Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> becauſe neither their office, nor their Authoritie, is from the Church, then neither may the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> nor the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> nor the <hi>Claſſis</hi> lay their hands upon them; becauſe their office and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is no more (nor ſo much) from them, as from the Church; nor by this Argument might the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves (if they were preſent) ordaine Officers, becauſe neither the <hi>office</hi> nor the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> is from the Apoſtles, but from <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely. Neither will it follow from hence (as ſome object) that if the <hi>Elders</hi> received their <hi>ordination from the Church,</hi> then they ſhould execute their office in the <hi>Churches name,</hi> or that then they may be more or leſſe diligent in their office at the <hi>Churches appointment,</hi> or that then the <hi>Church</hi> hath a <hi>Lord-like power over them,</hi> or that then the <hi>Elders</hi> muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their <hi>errand from the Church,</hi> as an Ambaſſadour doth from him from whom he receiveth his Commiſſion; or that then the <hi>Church,</hi> in defect of all Officers, may performe <hi>all duties of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> (as to adminiſter Sacraments, and the like.)</p>
                  <p>None of all theſe things will follow; For 1.

But all this notwithſtanding, they will not allow a <hi>brother</hi> offended to complaine to the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of another Church,</hi> till he ſee no hope of removall of the offence by his <hi>own Church</hi> at home.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Church being thus gathered and furniſhed with ſuch Officers, in ſuch manner as the Lord hath appointed; looke as in the firſt Primitive Church <hi>the Lord added to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:199168:29"/>them daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> Acts 2.47. ſo doe wee admit and receive from the Lord ſuch as he ſendeth and addeth to us. The firſt and loweſt <hi>number</hi> of a Church, to which the other members are added, is not expreſly limited in the Word, onely it is not ſo low as ſome have conceived, to conſiſt onely of <hi>two or three,</hi> it is a miſtake of that place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. where a promiſe of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence <hi>is made to two or three,</hi> to conceive it made to the loweſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church-body; for thoſe <hi>two or three,</hi> are not conſidered there as <hi>a Church-body,</hi> but as a <hi>ſufficient number of witneſſes,</hi> to joyne with a brother offended, in convincing and admoniſhing the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that gave the offence; againſt whom, if he doe not hearken to them, they are then further to proceed, and <hi>to tell the Church.</hi> Which argueth that they themſelves are not a Church, but a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler company agreeing in a dutie of brotherly love, either to heale an offending brother by their own admonition, or to witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him before the Church; and yet they have a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſts preſence with them in the dutie, leſt they might thinke ſuch a labour of love undertaken in vaine.</p>
                  <p>But the Church muſt needs be a <hi>greater number then two or three,</hi> ſeeing theſe two or three are to referre the perſon and the cauſe to a <hi>greater body</hi> then themſelves; for though there might be a <hi>dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Church</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> at the beginning, yet ſuch a Church which Chriſt hath <hi>inſtituted in the new Teſtament,</hi> conſiſteth of a greater number. The very <hi>Officers</hi> of a Church, compleatly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, are no leſſe <hi>then foure</hi> (a Paſtor, a Teacher, an Elder, a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,) and therefore the <hi>body</hi> of the Church had need to be of a greater number then ſo. And though the <hi>eſſence</hi> of a Church may conſiſt without the integritie of all his members (as a lame man that wanteth ſome of his members may have the eſſence of a man,) yet under ſeven, a Church can hardly conſiſt of ſo many members as doe performe any part of a Church-body.</p>
                  <p>To ſuch a body, how many members may be added, is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited expreſly in the Word, onely it is provided in the Word, that they be no more then that all may meet <hi>in one Congregation,</hi> that all may <hi>heare, and all may be edified.</hi> For (as hath been noted above) the Apoſtle ſo deſcribeth the whole <hi>Church as meeting in one place,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.23. But if <hi>all</hi> cannot <hi>heare, all</hi> cannot be <hi>edified.</hi> Beſides the Apoſtle requireth, that when the Church meeteth together for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:199168:30"/>the celebrating of the Lords Supper, <hi>they ſhall tarry one for another,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.33. Which argueth the Church indued with onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers, ſhould conſiſt of no greater number then that all might <hi>partake together of the Lords Supper in one Congregation,</hi> and therefore ſuch Pariſhes as conſiſt of 15000. though they were all fit materialls for Church-fellowſhip, yet ought to be divided into many Churches, as too large for one. When the hive is too full, Bees ſwarme into a new hive; ſo ſhould ſuch exceſſive numbers of Chriſtians iſſue forth into more Churches. Whence it appeareth to be an error, to ſay there is no limitation or diſtinction of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, meaning of Churches, <hi>(jure divino)</hi> for though a preciſe quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, a number of hundreds and thouſands be not limited to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church, yet ſuch a number is limited as falleth not <hi>below ſeven,</hi> nor riſeth <hi>above</hi> the bulke of <hi>one Congregation,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> wherein <hi>all may meete, and all may heare, and all may partake, and all may be edified together.</hi>

                  <p>THey that deſire to be added &amp; joyned to ſuch a body, they firſt make known their deſires to the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church, who take triall of their <hi>knowledge</hi> in the principles of religion, &amp; of their <hi>experience in the wayes of grace,</hi> and of their <hi>godly converſation</hi> amongſt men; that if any of them be found <hi>ignorant,</hi> and <hi>graceleſſe,</hi> or <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,</hi> he may not be preſently <hi>preſented to the Church,</hi> till theſe evils were removed. The ſtones that were to be laid in <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were ſquared and made ready before they were laid in the building; neither iron, nor ax, nor any iron toole was heard in the houſe while it was a building, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.7. And wherefore ſo, if not to hold forth that no members were to be received into the Church of Chriſt, but ſuch as were rough-hewen, and ſquared, and fitted to lie cloſe and levell to Chriſt and to his members?</p>
                  <p>But when ſuch as offer themſelves are <hi>approved of the Elders,</hi> they are <hi>propounded</hi> by one of the <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> to the Church, with a motion <hi>to the brethren</hi> to make inquiry after them, and if they ſhall heare of any juſt <hi>exceptions</hi> againſt them, to give <hi>notice of it to one of the Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if no exception be heard of, they are called forth before the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:199168:30"/>Church, after other holy duties are performed, and each one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth confeſſion of his ſinnes, and profeſſion of his faith. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his ſinnes (that it may appeare to be a penitent confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) he declareth alſo the grace of God to his ſoule, drawing him out of his ſinfull eſtate into fellowſhip with Chriſt. In the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his faith, he declareth not onely his good knowledge of the principles of Religion, but alſo his profeſſed ſubjection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, with his deſire of walking therein, with the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of that Church. Now before or after ſuch his profeſſion or confeſſion, thoſe of the brethren of the Church who are of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance doe give ſome good teſtimony (if need be) of his life and converſation; either according to their owne knowledge of him, or according to the credible reports or letters which they have received concerning him: which done, the <hi>Ruling Elder,</hi> or one of the <hi>Preaching Elders</hi> propoundeth it to the Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all that they have heard and ſeene, they finde any juſt exception againſt him? if ſo, it is cleared and removed before any further proceedings; if no juſt exception appeare, the <hi>Ruling Elder</hi> then moveth the Church to expreſſe their acceptance of him into fellowſhip with them, by lifting up their hands. Which done (and the like courſe taken with two or three more, as the time will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) the <hi>Elder</hi> propoundeth to them <hi>the heads of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with his Church, what promiſes of grace he hath made to them; as alſo what duties of faith and obedience he doth require of them; As to take the Lord Jeſus for their onely Prieſt and Atonement, their onely Prophet and guide, their onely King and Law-giver, and to walke in profeſſed ſubjection unto all his holy Ordinances; as alſo to walk in brotherly love with the brethren of this Church, unto mutuall edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuccour, according to the rule of the Goſpel.</hi> And the new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived members acknowledging this to be their dutie, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their conſent unto it in the name of Chriſt; the <hi>Elder</hi> doth further acquaint them with <hi>what duties of holy watchfulneſſe over them they may expect from the Church;</hi> and ſo ſhutteth up his worke with ſome ſhort prayer unto the Lord, who keepeth covenant and mercy with thouſands of his people, to make us all faithfull to him, and one to another, according to the rules of his holy Goſpel in Chriſt Jeſus, the Mediator, and ſuretie of his Covenant, between the Lord and his people.</p>

                  <p>NOw what offence is there in all this? or what ſcruple may ariſe in a godly minde againſt theſe things? Two or three things ſeeme herein offenſive, but are not.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That wee require gracious qualifications in ſuch as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to Church-fellowſhip: whereas the viſible Church is ſaid to conſiſt of all ſorts, good and bad, and to be a garner containing chaffe and wheate, as a field wherein wheate and tares grow up together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That we receive ſuch into the Church by a covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That we communicate too much power unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and doe not rather referre all power (in this caſe) into the hands of the <hi>Elders.</hi> To give therefore ſome account of theſe, as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, though wee willingly admit all commers to the <hi>hearing</hi> of the Word with us (as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> admitted Infidels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25.) yet wee <hi>receive none as members into the Church,</hi> but ſuch as (according to the judgement of charitable Chriſtians) may be conceived to be received of God into fellowſhip with Chriſt, the head of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Our Reaſons be;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the neare relation between Chriſt Jeſus, and the Church;</hi> as alſo between the Church and the other perſons in the Trinitie: the Lord Jeſus is the head of the Church, even of the <hi>viſible Church;</hi> and the viſible Church is the body of Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. The <hi>viſible Church</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>habitation of God by the Spirit, Eph.</hi> 2.22. to be the <hi>Temple of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the Spirit of God to <hi>dwell in them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. to be Eſpouſed to Chriſt as a chaſte Virgin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. The members of the viſible Church are ſaid to be the <hi>ſonnes and daughters of the Lord God Almightie,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.18. and are exhorted <hi>to be followers of him as deare children,</hi> Eph. 4.1. Now how can the viſible Church be the members of the body, or the Spouſe of Chriſt, or the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, or the ſonnes and daughters of the heavenly Father, except the members in charitable diſcretion be (as indeed the holy Ghoſt deſcribeth them to be) <hi>Saints by calling,</hi> (1 Cor. 1.2.) and <hi>faithfull brethren,</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:199168:31"/>Gal. 1.2. and that not onely by externall profeſſion, for theſe are too high ſtiles for hypocrites, but in ſome meaſure of ſinceritie and truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We reade <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. that the <hi>Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> and how then ſhall wee adde to the Church ſuch as God addeth not? ſuch as have no ſhew of any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving worke upon them to any ſpirituall diſcerning? ought not the Lords Stewards to be faithfull in Gods houſe, and to doe nothing therein, but as they ſee the Lord goe before them? receiving whom he receiveth, and refuſing whom he refuſeth, caſting out whom he caſteth out. Doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> upon this ground di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the <hi>Romanes</hi> to receive <hi>a weak beleever, becauſe the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him?</hi> Rom. 14.1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord Jeſus maketh the profeſſion of the faith of his name, and ſuch a profeſſion as <hi>fleſh and bloud hath not revealed</hi> to a man, but his heavenly Father; to be the rocke on which his viſible Church is built; for he ſpeaketh of ſuch a Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he committeth the keys of his kingdome, and that is the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. to 19. Now if ſuch a profeſſion be the rocke and foundation of a viſible Church, then wee ſhall build a Church without a foundation, if wee receive ſuch members into the Church as doe not hold forth ſuch a profeſſion, but either through ignorance make no profeſſion at all, or ſuch a verball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as ſavoureth not of any bleſſed worke of the Father by his Spirit upon their hearts. And doth not the lord expoſtulate with <hi>ſuch a gueſt</hi> as comes into the fellowſhip of his Church, even unto his Table, <hi>not having a wedding garment,</hi> Mat. 22.12? And doth not expoſtulation intimate a <hi>Taxation alſo of them, by whoſe conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence he came in,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>how comeſt thou in hither?</hi> And doth not Chriſt in the parable impute it to the <hi>ſleepineſſe</hi> (that is, to the remiſneſſe and negligence) <hi>of his ſervants,</hi> that tares were ſowen in his field amongſt the wheate, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.25.38.39.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Such as have onely a <hi>forme of godlineſſe, and deny the power of it, wee are forbidden to joyne with, and commanded to turne from them,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Can any man judge ſuch perſons fit materialls for the conſtituting and edifying of a Church, who are more fit for the ruine and deſtruction of the Church; ſuch as leave their firſt love
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:199168:32"/>(as all hypocrites will at length?) They procure the removall of the candleſtick, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. Wee paſſe by the types of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which yet are not without their due weight; it was touched above, that <hi>rough ſtones were not laid in the building of Solomons Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, till they were hewen and prepared before,</hi> 1 King. 6.7. and behold <hi>a greater then Solomon is here,</hi> and a greater <hi>Temple</hi> then that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons;</hi> the attendance and <hi>watchfulneſſe of the porters ſuffering none to enter into the Temple that were uncleane in any thing,</hi> 2 Chro. 23.19. doth it not evidently type forth the watchfulneſſe of the Officers of the Church of Chriſt, to ſuffer none uncleane (uncleane in eſtate or courſe of life) to enter into the fellowſhip of the Church, which ought to be a Communion of Saints?</p>
                  <p>Well then, if all the members of the Church ought to be <hi>Saints by calling, and faithfull brethren,</hi> it cannot be thought an unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble curioſitie, but rather held a due and faithfull watchfulneſſe in the Officers and body of every Church of Chriſt, to take a due triall of men by a <hi>confeſſion of ſinnes,</hi> as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.6. and by a <hi>profeſſion of their faith,</hi> as <hi>Philip</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. before they receive them into the church as members of the body of the Lord Jeſus; neither was it an exceſſive auſteritie in <hi>John,</hi> but an holy faithfulneſſe and godly zeale, not onely to repulſe the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> Mat. 3.7. but the <hi>prophane people alſo</hi> from his Baptiſme, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.7. as thoſe who were a <hi>generation of vipers, and had not yet brought forth fruit meet for repentance,</hi> ver. 7, 8. and therefore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were not meete for his Baptiſme, which was a baptiſme of repentance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.3. Nevertheleſſe, in this triall, wee doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act eminent meaſure, either of knowledge, or holineſſe, but doe willingly ſtretch out our hands to receive <hi>the weake in faith,</hi> ſuch in whoſe ſpirits wee can diſcerne <hi>the leaſt meaſure of breathing and panting after Chriſt, in their ſenſible feeling of a loſt eſtate;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">☞</note> for we had rather 99. hypocrites ſhould periſh through preſumption, then one humble ſoule belonging to Chriſt, ſhould ſinke under diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or deſpaire; and by reaſon of theſe hypocrites received into the Church, it is that the Church is ſaid to have in it good and bad, wheate and tares; for tares, (as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith) are like to wheate.</p>

                  <p>COme wee now to give account of the ſecond point, why wee receive ſuch into the Church by way of <hi>Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Meete it is that as the whole Church was received as one <hi>body</hi> unto Chriſt by profeſſing their entrance into covenant with God, as hath been ſhewed above in the third Propoſition of the fift part, ſo every member of the Church ſhould be received into the ſame fellowſhip, by profeſſion of their taking hold of the ſame Covenant; <hi>Eadem eſtratio partium &amp; totius,</hi> there is the ſame reaſon of the whole and of the parts, in ſuch things as concerne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature of both; And as all relatives doe, they mutually ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue one another. Hence it is that when godly ſtrangers (who had joyned themſelves to the Lord, to wit, by faith, to ſerve him, to love his name, and keep his Sabbath) were to be brought into the fellowſhip of the Lords houſe, they added this dutie over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the former, they <hi>took hold of the Covenant of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 56.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Surely not <hi>by faith onely,</hi> for their <hi>perſonall ſalvation,</hi> (for <hi>ſo</hi> they took hold of the covenant before <hi>when they joyned themſelves to the Lord,</hi> ver. 3.) but by their profeſſion of their <hi>acceptance of the Covenant, and ſubjection to it, which the Lord maketh with his Church and people, whom he cauſeth to paſſe into the bond of the Covenant,</hi> Ezek. 20.37.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It is objected firſt, that the place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh of ſuch <hi>ſtrangers as were proſelytes,</hi> who in joyning themſelves to the <hi>Lord,</hi> were therein alſo joyned unto the <hi>Church,</hi> for ſo <hi>joyning to the Lord, implyeth joyning to the Church,</hi> Jer. 50.5. Zech. 2.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. They that joyned to the Lord in thoſe Texts of <hi>Jeremie</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi> did indeed in ſo doing joyne in a Church-body alſo; for they who are there ſpoken of were a multitude, concurring and conſenting in the ſame Covenant, to joyne to the Lord, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his people; but here in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Eunuch and ſtrangers are ſaid to be joyned to the Lord, who yet were not joyned to the Church, but ready to complaine <hi>that the Lord had utterly deprived them of that libertie of joyning to the Church, and had utterly ſeparated them from his people,</hi> ver. 3. As indeed he had by expreſſe Law <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them,</hi> that is, <hi>prohibited them from entring into the Congregation of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:199168:33"/>the Lord for ever,</hi> Deut. 23.1, 2, 3. Againſt which Law the Lord comforteth them with this promiſe of the Goſpel, that in the new Teſtament, neither their <hi>Eunuchicall</hi> eſtate, nor the <hi>alienation</hi> or <hi>ſtrangerneſſe</hi> of any Nation, ſhall be an impediment unto their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Lords houſe, which is the Church.</p>
                  <p>The joyning (there ſpoken of) is not their joyning to the Lord and his people as <hi>Proſelytes</hi> of the Church; for though they were joyned to the Lord, yet they complained of their disjoyning and ſeparating from the Lords people, but the Lord comforteth them with this promiſe, that <hi>ſuch as are joyned to the Lord,</hi> he will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bring them to <hi>his houſe;</hi> no bodily <hi>infirmitie,</hi> (as that of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi>) nor nationall <hi>pollution</hi> (as that of ſome <hi>ſtrangers</hi>) ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their admittance into his Church, onely this the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both of the <hi>Eunuches,</hi> ver. 4. and of the <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> ver. 6. who had joyned themſelves <hi>to the Lord before,</hi> that they doe <hi>alſo</hi> take <hi>hold of his Covenant</hi> (as antecedent to their entrance into Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,) to wit, take hold of it by <hi>ſolemne profeſſion</hi> of their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it, and of their ſubjection to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It is not credible that the Lord would ever ſeparate or debarre ſuch from Church-fellowſhip as were joyned to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by faith, who can thinke it? what reaſon can you give for it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The text is plaine, that <hi>Eunuches, Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> were ſeparated from the Church or Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ever, without exception of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> or <hi>ungodlineſſe.</hi> Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make a doubt whether the Law againſt <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> reached to the <hi>women</hi> of thoſe Nations; but againſt <hi>men</hi> the Law is cleare. But if the Law had excluded them onely upon point of their own <hi>ungodlineſſe,</hi> that was no <hi>ſingular</hi> curſe to them.

                  <p>So that from the place in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> wee have two paſſages of our practiſes in <hi>admitting Church-members,</hi> witneſſed unto and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Lord.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That thoſe whom the Lord <hi>joyneth to the Church</hi> in the new Teſtament, are ſuch as have been joyned <hi>to himſelfe,</hi> to love him, and to ſerve him, and keep his Sabbaths.</item>
                     <item>2. That they doe alſo <hi>take hold of his Covenant with his Church,</hi> before he bring them into his holy <hi>Mountaine</hi> which is <hi>his Church.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Both which are the more to be obſerved in this place, becauſe the place is a <hi>propheſie</hi> of what the Lord <hi>will doe</hi> in the dayes of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> to wit, when his houſe ſhall be called <hi>an houſe of prayer unto all Nations,</hi> ver. 9. which is proper to the <hi>times of the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. But the <hi>Covenant</hi> here ſpoken of, hath nothing to doe with the <hi>Church Covenant,</hi> for the Covenant is the <hi>Lords between him and his people,</hi> but the <hi>Church Covenant is between the members of the Church</hi> one towards another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This objection was prevented before in the firſt point; for when the Lord entreth into covenant with his people, that is, with his Church, his Church either expreſly, or by ſilent conſent covenanteth with him, and alſo one with another, to yeeld pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſubjection to him, as hath been ſhewed above.</p>
                  <p>But though this place <hi>prophecying of the dayes of the new Teſtament,</hi> ſpeak expreſly of <hi>taking hold of the Covenant</hi> before entring into the Church, yet let no man wonder why there is ſo little expreſſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poeples taking hold of the Covenant in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when this promiſe commeth to be accompliſhed. In the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> where the <hi>Church and Common-wealth</hi> grew up together in divine inſtitution and adminiſtration, there is expreſſe mention
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:199168:34"/>of this Covenant, and the Church being nationall, and all the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> being members of the Church from the firſt plantation of it, the Covenant of the Lord with his Church was not at all <hi>ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> to them, (who were parties to it themſelves) but very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; but in the dayes of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and Princes of the earth being <hi>Aliens</hi> and <hi>enemies</hi> to the Church, the Apoſtles thought it meete to ſpeake of this Covenant not <hi>plainly,</hi> but as it were in <hi>Parables and ſimilitudes,</hi> as knowing the name of <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Covenanters</hi> might breed no ſmall <hi>jealouſies in Civill States,</hi> as ſeeming moſt dangerous to civill peace, but yet in apt ſimilitudes they ſo deſcribe the eſtate of Churches as doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply a joynt Covenant, both <hi>between the Lord, and them me with another:</hi> which may ſerve for a ſecond argument to prove the point in hand, the receiving of Members by way of Covenant; for 1. they ſo deſcribe every Church of God, as a <hi>Citie of God,</hi> as the <hi>new Hieruſalem,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> at their firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſtyled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. and the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> though it may be a more <hi>glorious Church</hi> then any of the <hi>Churches of the Gentiles,</hi> yet it partaketh in the <hi>common nature</hi> of them all, <hi>every true Church</hi> is as well a <hi>Citie of God,</hi> as the <hi>Church of the Jewes;</hi> and hence the Members of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> are called <hi>fellow-Citizens</hi> with the Saints, as being of the houſhold, or Church of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. Now every <hi>Citie</hi> is founded in ſome <hi>confederacy</hi> by oath, or ſuch like bond, and every <hi>Citizen</hi> is received into the ſame Citie, by taking the <hi>ſame</hi> oath, or entring into the ſame bond, wherein the whole Citie ſtandeth ingaged; which holdeth forth to an intelligent heart, that if every Church of the new Teſtament be a Citie, and the Members thereof fellow-Citizens, then as the whole Church is planted and founded <hi>in ſome Covenant</hi> or <hi>Confederacie;</hi> ſo every Member of the Church is implanted and received into the ſame body, by <hi>taking hold of the ſame Covenant,</hi> and profeſſing ſubjection thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the planting of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> calleth it <hi>eſpouſing</hi> of it as a chaſte Virgin unto Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. It implyeth plainly, that he drew them all as one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to profeſſe their acceptance of Chriſt as an <hi>husband</hi> to them all, and of one another, <hi>as member</hi> of the <hi>ſame body:</hi> if he had ſpoken of his <hi>converſion</hi> of their <hi>particular ſoules</hi> unto Chriſt, he would not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:199168:34"/>have ſpoken of them as <hi>one virgin,</hi> but ſo <hi>many ſoules</hi> ſo <hi>many virgins;</hi> but now ſpeaking of them all as <hi>one virgin,</hi> it plainly argueth he joyned them all as one virgin into one body, and that one body into a <hi>Covenant of Eſpouſalls</hi> with Chriſt Jeſus; for there are no Eſpouſalls without a covenant; and therefore they that will take hold of their Eſpouſage, muſt take hold of their covenant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The mutuall relation wherein all the members in the Church ſtand one to another, members to members, and all of them to their Officers, and their Officers to them, together with their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall intereſt one in another, and mutuall power one over another, doe all of them neceſſarily imply a mutuall confederacie one with another; and that whoſoever will partake herein, muſt partake in their confederacie. Suppoſe a godly Chriſtian come over into theſe parts, (as every yeare ſome or other doe) there is not any Miniſter of any of our Churches can <hi>uſurpe Paſtorall authoritie over him,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that Chriſtian <hi>call him thereunto,</hi> or profeſſe his ſubjection to his Miniſtration, according to God. Nor can ſuch a man expect any <hi>Miniſters watchfulneſſe over him as his Miniſter,</hi> unleſſe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſee juſt cauſe to <hi>accept ſuch a charge, and profeſſe ſo much.</hi> No <hi>Church</hi> in the Countrey, nor all the members of any Church, can take upon them to <hi>Cenſure any ſtranger,</hi> though an inhabitant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, unleſſe <hi>he give up himſelfe to them,</hi> and profeſſe his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Goſpel of Chriſt amongſt them. Nor can <hi>he</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge <hi>ſuch watchfulneſſe from them,</hi> unleſſe he have given them <hi>a juſt call</hi> to take upon them that care over him. That <hi>Chriſtian libertie</hi> which the Lord Jeſus by his bloud hath purchaſed for his Church, and for all his children, giveth them all <hi>libertie to chooſe their owne Officers,</hi> and their <hi>owne fellow-Members,</hi> unto whom to commit the care of their ſoules according to the rules of the Goſpel. We ſpeak not of <hi>Infants,</hi> who <hi>make choice in their parents,</hi> but of ſuch who know their libertie, and are called to ſtand faſt in it: till then that a man tender and offer himſelfe to the Church, (to the Officers and Members of it) they have no power to <hi>receive</hi> him; For the Churches receiving a beleever (which is the Apoſtles <hi>word,</hi> Rom. 14.1.) implyeth and preſuppoſeth his <hi>offering</hi> and <hi>giving up</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto them, in a <hi>profeſſed ſubjection</hi> to the Lord, and unto them, according to the will of God; and their <hi>receiving</hi> of him, implyeth and holdeth forth no leſſe then their <hi>profeſſed acceptance</hi> of him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:199168:35"/>all thoſe holy liberties with them, and performance of all ſuch ſpirituall duties to him, which belong to all the fellow-members of the ſame body; and let men call this expreſſion of mutuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement by what name they pleaſe, this is no other then what wee call <hi>Church-Covenant.</hi>

                  <p>LEt us proceed then to give account of the third point, why we communicate ſo much power to the <hi>people,</hi> as to propound <hi>receiving of Members,</hi> unto their approbation and conſent: our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the like power given unto them by Chriſt, for the caſting out of ſcandalous and corrupt members, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. if the Church muſt be <hi>told of every member</hi> that is to be <hi>caſt out,</hi> and when he is to be <hi>caſt out,</hi> they are to <hi>deliver him to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:</hi> then the Church muſt be told of every member that is <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and when he is to be received, they are <hi>to receive him</hi> into the fellowſhip of the Lord, and of his Church; but the former is cleare from thoſe Scriptures, and conſequently the latter. It is a received Maxime, <hi>Ejuſdem eſt poteſtatis aperire &amp; claudere, inſtituere &amp; deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere</hi> (as they call it,) they that have power to <hi>ſhut</hi> the doores of the Church by Excommunication, they have power <hi>to open</hi> the doores of the Church by admitting to Communion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the Example of the <hi>Church at Hieruſalem,</hi> Act. 9.26. who when <hi>Paul</hi> aſſayeth to joyne himſelfe unto them, did not at firſt <hi>receive</hi> him, becauſe the Diſciples were not ſatisfied in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good eſtate, untill <hi>Barnabas</hi> by his teſtimony of him had removed their ſcruple: which argueth the <hi>private brethren</hi> in a Church as well as <hi>publique Officers,</hi> muſt be ſatisfied in him who is to be received into Communion with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the Churches power in Electing and calling Miniſters to office. It hath been ſhewed above, that it belongeth to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the body of the Church, to <hi>chooſe and call their owne Officers,</hi> according to the ſpeech of <hi>Cyprian, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 41. <hi>Plebs maxime poteſtatem habet, vel ſacerdotes dignos eligendi, velindignos recuſandi.</hi> And if they have ſuch power of chooſing worthy <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the unworthy, how much more of receiving worthy <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:199168:35"/>and refuſing of unworthy. Yea, in the Epiſtle going before, he ſpeaketh expreſly, <hi>he had much adoe to perſwade the people to receive ſome, whoſe repentance was not ſo cleare to them;</hi> which argueth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently their power in receiving Members.</p>

                  <p>Our reaſon hereof (one in ſtead of many) is taken from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Commiſſion of the Lord Jeſus given to his Apoſtles, which is as large as ever was given to any Church-governours, and yet reacheth no further then to teach the people to obſerve <hi>all things whatſoever I have commanded you,</hi> Mat. 28.20.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If any ſhall ſay, the Apoſtles Commiſſion reacheth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>matters of ſubſtance,</hi> not <hi>circumſtances,</hi> of worſhip and formes of <hi>neceſſitie,</hi> not <hi>indifferency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee anſwer, let them ſhew us another Commiſſion to authorize them to put lawes upon the Churches for matters of <hi>circumſtance</hi> (of formes and of <hi>indifferencie</hi>) and wee ſhall ſubmit, but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holds forth no ſuch Commiſſion given to any of the ſonnes of men ſince the world began.</p>
                  <p>That much urged place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. doth not authorize the Church, nor any Church-governours, to make lawes for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſuch things as they ſhall account <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>orderly;</hi> but onely provideth that all the <hi>ordinances of God,</hi> whether prayer, or propheſie, or ſinging of Pſalmes, or tongues, or interpretations, be <hi>all of them done decently, without uncomelineſſe, and orderly, without confuſion;</hi> and that this place reacheth no further, appeareth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently from hence, that if this place ſhould give unto the Church, or unto Church-governours, authoritie to preſcribe and command <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> things at their owne diſcretion, a man could not tranſgreſſe the <hi>Commandement</hi> of the Church, but he ſhould alſo tranſgreſſe the <hi>Commandement</hi> of the Apoſtle; but the contrary is evident. For ſuppoſe the Church or Church-governours ſhould make an order, that Miniſters ſhould alwayes preach in a <hi>gowne,</hi> the thing is decent enough, but nevertheleſſe if a man ſhall preach in a cloake, he ſhall tranſgreſſe the order of the Church, but not of the Apoſtle; for he that preacheth in a cloake, preacheth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently alſo; which plainly argueth, that ſuch a commandement of the Church, is not grounded upon the commandement of the Apoſtle.</p>

                  <p>FIrſt then when wee come together in the Church, according to the Apoſtles direction, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. wee make prayers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions and thankſgivings for our ſelves and for all men, not in any <hi>preſcribed</hi> forme of prayer, or <hi>ſtudied Liturgie,</hi> but in ſuch a

                  <p>After prayer, either the <hi>Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> readeth a Chapter in the Bible, and <hi>expoundeth</hi> it, giving the <hi>ſenſe, to cauſe the people to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the reading,</hi> according to <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.8.

                  <p>Before Sermon, and many times after, wee ſing a Pſalme, and becauſe the former tranſlation of the Pſalmes, doth in many things vary from the originall, and many times paraphraſeth rather then tranſlateth; beſides divers other defects (which we cover in ſilence) wee have endeavoured a new tranſlation of the Pſalmes into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh meetre,</hi> as neere the originall as wee could expreſſe it in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, ſo farre as for the preſent the Lord hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to helpe us, and thoſe Pſalmes wee ſing, both in our publick Churches, and in private.</p>

                  <p>In time of <hi>ſolemnization</hi> of the Supper, the Miniſter having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, bleſſed, and broken the bread, and commanded all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take and eate it, as the body of Chriſt broken for them, he taketh it himſelfe, and giveth it to all that ſit at Table with him, and from the Table it is reached by the <hi>Deacons</hi> to the people ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the next ſeats about them, the Miniſter ſitting in his place at the Table.</p>

For in the old Teſtament at their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſts none was to <hi>appeare before the Lord empty,</hi> Deut. 16.16.

                  <p>And to that purpoſe the Apoſtle gave order unto the Churches, that <hi>upon the firſt day of the weeke every one ſhould lay by him, into the treaſury</hi> (as the word ſignifieth) <hi>for the ſupply of the Saints, as God had proſpened them,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2.

                  <p>IN all theſe adminiſtrations, onely two or three things may ſeeme to require clearing from the Word of God; as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Why in our publick prayers, wee forbeare to uſe <hi>ſet formes</hi> of preſcript Liturgies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why in our Sacraments wee doe not admit the members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the fellowſhip of the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> and their children to Baptiſme, as was ſaid before, wee did receive the Members of other Churches in this Countrey.</p>
                  <p>For the former, the reaſons uſually given may ſuffice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the patterne of all the Churches, both in the old and new Teſtament, God never gave leave to any ordinary Officers
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:199168:38"/>of his Church, neither did any of them take leave to impoſe any formes of Liturgie upon any Church. And yet if ever there had been place for preſcribing ſet formes to any, it had been moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in the <hi>Jewiſh Synagogues,</hi> whoſe members being as children under age, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.2, 3.) might ſtand in moſt need of ſuch a help. It is eaſily acknowledged, <hi>Moſes</hi> preſcribed a forme of bleſſing, <hi>Nunb.</hi> 6.23. to 26. and <hi>David</hi> ſundry Pſalmes of praiſe and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and the Lord Jeſus taught his Diſciples not onely to pray <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner,</hi> but thus, or theſe words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. But neither were theſe <hi>ordinary</hi> Officers of the Churches, neither did they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe any uſe but <hi>arbitrary</hi> and occaſionall of theſe formes; as they might ſuite our occaſions. God by immediate revelation, and by the hand of his <hi>extraordinary Meſſengers,</hi> may preſcribe this or that forme to his Church, but will not warrant ordinary Officers (who have onely received a common meaſure of the Spirit) to doe the like. God who forbad his people to make to themſelves Images or imaginations, inventions, and formes of worſhip, hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained himſelfe to ſet up what images or formes himſelfe ſeeth good.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are not applyed to be matter and forme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or thankſgiving without commandement, or at leaſt without ſuch directions as amount to a lawfull warrant from God; for <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly ſaith, <hi>On this wiſe ſhall yee bleſſe the Children of Iſrael, and ſay unto them,</hi> (Numb. 6.23.) The 102. Pſalme is expreſſed in the title, not onely to be a prayer <hi>of one that was afflicted, but of any in like eſtate.</hi> And the Apoſtles exhortation is generall concerning all the Pſalmes and hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs of <hi>David,</hi> (as well as of others) that wee ſhould ſing them with holy melody unto the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. and Chriſts words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. <hi>When yee pray ſay our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon why wee forbeare a ſet forme of preſcript Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, is taken from the meaning of the ſecond Commandement, which wee conceive prohibiteth ſuch preſcript Liturgies.</p>
                  <p>It is a rule generally knowne in the expoſition of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:199168:39"/>that all ſinnes forbidden in the Word of God, are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the ten Commandements, and fall under the prohibition of one of them or other, for there is no ſinne but is a tranſgreſſion of ſome or other commandement of the law, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. and upon the two Tables of the <hi>Law hang all the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Mat. 22.40. Now it is plaine, that all ſinnes are not contained in the letter of the ten Commandements, and therefore there is no judicious Expoſitor of them, but openeth the letter of the Commandements by <hi>Synecdoches</hi> and <hi>Metonymies; Synecdoches</hi> to comprehend all ſinnes of the <hi>like kinde,</hi> and all the <hi>degrees</hi> thereof, and <hi>Metonymies</hi> to comprehend all <hi>cauſes</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> and occaſions thereof; ſo that for opening the ſecond Commandement, which forbids both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and the worſhipping of any image or ſimilitude, it is requiſite to conſider in what ſenſe or reſpects <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>ſimilitudes</hi> are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: Images or ſimilitudes are forbidden in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, not as <hi>objects</hi> of worſhip, for all <hi>falſe objects</hi> of worſhip are the <hi>falſe gods</hi> forbidden in the firſt Commandement; <hi>Images</hi> then and <hi>ſimilitudes</hi> are forbidden in the ſecond Commandement, not as falſe objects of worſhip, wherein the worſhip is terminated and faſtned, but as <hi>falſe meanes of worſhipping</hi> the true God. For ſo are the Images conſidered that are forbidden in the Word. The <hi>golden calfe</hi> was not conſidered as the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> that brought them up out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but as an <hi>Image</hi> of that <hi>Jehovah</hi> which did bring them up out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Whence it is ſaid, that <hi>Aaron</hi> proclaimed a feaſt, not to the <hi>calfe,</hi> but to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whereof the <hi>calfe</hi> was but an <hi>Image. To morrow,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is a ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> (or feaſt) <hi>to Jehovah,</hi> Exod. 32.5. The <hi>Calfe</hi> therefore was not the god, but the Image of the god which they worſhipped, as that which reſembled him, and put them in minde of him, helped their hearts nearer to him, or his preſence nearer to them: As it is written in the Pſalme, that <hi>they turned their glory into the ſimilitude of an oxe that eateth graſſe,</hi> Pſal. 106.20. And in this oxe or calfe they looked at <hi>Jehovah as neare unto them, and as going with them, and before them,</hi> Exod. 32.1. Furthermore, the Image forbidden in the ſecond Commandement, is not onely a <hi>falſe meanes</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, deviſed by man, but a <hi>falſe manner</hi> of worſhip alſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the <hi>Samaritane</hi>-ſtrangers knew not the <hi>manner</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God in the <hi>Calves of Jeroboam,</hi> it is ſaid, they knew not the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:199168:39"/>
                     <hi>manner of the god of the Countrey</hi> (2 Kings 17.26.) and one of the Prieſts of the high places was ſent to teach them the <hi>manner of the feare</hi> (or worſhip) <hi>of Jehovah,</hi> ver. 28. and ſo <hi>they feared Jehovah af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the former manner,</hi> ver. 34. and that was <hi>in ſerving him in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Images of their owne deviſing,</hi> ver. 41.</p>
                  <p>So that under this one kinde of falſe worſhip of God in graven Images, is forbidden by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> not onely all worſhip of God in <hi>carved or molten or painted Images,</hi> (all bodily repreſentations of God) but all <hi>ſpirituall Images alſo, which are the imaginations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men,</hi> whether they be ordained for worſhip, as the <hi>high places</hi> erected to the true God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.17. and the <hi>deviſed feaſt of the eighth moneth,</hi> 2 King. 12.33. or whether they be brought in and uſed for <hi>helpes and meanes</hi> of worſhip, as the <hi>ſtrange fire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab,</hi> Levit. 10.1, 2. and <hi>Davids new Cart</hi> to carry the Arke, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.3. with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.13. or whether they be uſed for <hi>manner and forme</hi> of worſhip, as <hi>preaching in the wiſdom of mans words,</hi> (or in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Eloquence) which is but a painted Image of preaching (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4.) and ſo forbidden in this ſecond Commandement. In like ſort, <hi>Womens praying in publick bare-headed, and men covered,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.4, 5. Mens praying or prophecying in <hi>ſtrange tongues,</hi> and many of them at once, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22.26. the celebrating of <hi>love-feaſts</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Aſſemblies, together with the Lords Supper,</hi> (1 Cor. 11.21.23.34.) are all of them Images or imaginations of men, formes or <hi>manners</hi> of worſhip deviſed and uſed by man, but not ordained by God, and ſo forbidden in this ſecond Commandement.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon whereof is taken from the perfection of the wiſdome of God revealed in Scripture, to <hi>make the man of God perfect to every good worke,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.17. No wiſdome of mans device, as any other worſhip, or any other <hi>helpes</hi> or <hi>meanes</hi> of worſhip, or any <hi>formes</hi> or <hi>manners</hi> of worſhip, acceptable to God, but what the wiſdome of God hath directed us in his Word. Beſides, the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate in Chriſt, (<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.10.) ſo as wee need no other <hi>Prieſt</hi> to make atonement but him, nor other ſpirituall <hi>King</hi> but him to rule our conſciences, no other <hi>Prophet</hi> to teach us but himſelfe, and ſuch as he hath appointed to that end; thus the ſum and ſubſtance both of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> lead us to reſt in the ordinances of God, and not to helpe our ſelves by the inventions of men, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the worſhip of God. To apply this then to ſet-formes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:199168:40"/>of prayer, deviſed by man, and preſcribed to be read out of a brooke, and ſo taken up by one Church from another, as the formes of their worſhip, and as the meanes and helpe of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, wee finde no command or patterne for them in the Word, nor any promiſe of their acceptance. They are injoyned for means and helps of Gods worſhip, which he hath not ſanctified, and for formes of worſhip which God hath not acknowledged. What dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is there between the carrying of the <hi>Arke</hi> upon a <hi>Cart,</hi> and our <hi>prayers</hi> upon a <hi>Booke?</hi> whereas both ſhould be <hi>carried,</hi> the one upon the <hi>ſhoulders</hi> of the Levites, the other upon the <hi>gifts</hi> of the Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. God hath in generall commanded us to worſhip him in publick with all manner of prayers and ſupplication, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.) but prayers upon a booke, ſtinted Liturgies, are ſome manner of prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> God that in generall commandeth all manner of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, commandeth alſo in ſpeciall the ſeverall kinds of prayers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupplications, interceſſions, thankſgivings, or the like. He that commandeth the <hi>Genus,</hi> commandeth the diſtribution of it into all its <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but he that commandeth the <hi>ſubject,</hi> doth not alwaies command the diſtribution of it into all its <hi>adjuncts;</hi> he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth <hi>prayer</hi> in <hi>generall,</hi> alloweth every <hi>kinde</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> but not every <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>prayer;</hi> for then God ſhould allow prayer in a <hi>ſtrange tongue,</hi> prayer <hi>before Images,</hi> prayer in the <hi>corners of the ſtreets,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. If ſet-formes of preſcript prayers be unlawfull, then ſet-formes of <hi>confeſſion of faith,</hi> ſet-formes of <hi>Catechiſme</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It followeth not; for the Apoſtle commandeth us to keepe a forme <hi>of ſound words in faith and love,</hi> that is, in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.) but he no where commandeth us to keepe a forme of <hi>ſound prayer,</hi> unleſſe it be a forme of <hi>directions</hi> and inſtructions, how to pray, and that is included in the former, and wee diſlike it not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. The Apoſtle did not command <hi>Timothy</hi> to deviſe himſelfe a forme of ſound words, &amp; to preſcribe the ſame to the Churches, without ſuffering ought to be added to it, or taken from it, but what he muſt commend to others, were the things that he <hi>heard
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:199168:40"/>of Paul among many witneſſes, which he was to commit to faithfull men, who might be able to teach others alſo,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For a third reaſon why we doe not take up ſet-formes of preſcript Liturgies, is taken from the like proportion of ſet-formes, both of <hi>preſcript Liturgies,</hi> and of <hi>preſcript Sermons</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</hi> Prayer and preaching are both of them publick duties of the miniſteriall office. The Apoſtles tell the Church they will lay down the <hi>Deacons imployment,</hi> that they may give themſelves to the <hi>miniſtery of the word and prayer,</hi> Act. 6. In the one, they are the <hi>mouth of God to the people;</hi> in the other, they are the <hi>mouth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto God.</hi> If wee preſcribe to one another ſet-formes of <hi>prayer,</hi> why not <hi>ſet-formes of Homilies?</hi> and then neither the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> nor their <hi>ſucceſſors</hi> needed to have left off their imployment in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring to Tables, to attend the miniſtry of the Word and prayer, (<hi>Acts</hi> 6.4.) for both are prepared to their hands, by the preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others. Whence alſo it will follow, that Miniſters ſhall lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle need to edifie the Church by their owne gifts received of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to that end, but may edifie them by the gifts of <hi>others.</hi> Yea, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, though deſtitute of <hi>miniſteriall gifts,</hi> may be fit for the <hi>publick diſcharge of their duties</hi> by the helpe of <hi>other mens gifts,</hi> both in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and preaching; and ſo indeed a preſcript Liturgie is properly a maintenance to all <hi>Idoll dumb Miniſters.</hi> And in this forbearance of preſcript prayers, as we follow the example of the Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and of the <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> Churches, ſo wee are not deſtitute of patterns in this caſe of thoſe that ſucceeded them. <q rend="inline">
                        <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his ſecond Apologie for Chriſtians, a hundred and fifty yeares after Chriſt, ſpeaketh of the <hi>ruler</hi> of the Church, ſending up prayers and praiſes to God, without mentioning any <hi>preſcript forme,</hi> according to his power (or facultie) of prayer, or thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, left him by the Apoſtles or others. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> about 203. yeares after Chriſt, in his Apologie for Chriſtians, ſaith, they prayed <hi>ſine monitore, quia de pectore,</hi> without a prompter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they prayed from their heart, <hi>Tertull.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:199168:41"/>it had been an unskilfull and ſinfull neglect, both in <hi>Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> to omit ſuch publick evidences of their profeſſed loyaltie and devotion to the State.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let it firſt be knowne what we doe, and then conſider up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground wee doe it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee doe not admit the members of other Churches in this Countrey, unleſſe they bring with them Letters of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Churches whence they came; or at leaſt unleſſe thoſe Churches have made knowne to us their deſire, that their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers coming occaſionally amongſt us, may be received to the Lords Table, with our owne, by vertue of communion of Churches.</p>

                  <p>Now the grounds upon which wee thus walke, are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the power requiſite to the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, <hi>viz.</hi> to adminiſter a Sacrament, is not an act of <hi>Chriſtian libertie,</hi> that every Chriſtian may diſpenſe to whom he pleaſe, but an <hi>act of power,</hi> which Chriſt hath given to them who are called to be Miniſters of the Word, and by them to be diſpenſed unto the Church, whereof the Holy Ghoſt hath made them over-ſeers. They then over whom wee have no <hi>miniſteriall power,</hi> unto them wee may not diſpenſe an <hi>act of power;</hi> but they who are Members of no Church, wee have no miniſteriall power over them; and they who are Members of other Churches (not of our own) wee have no power over them, further then they are recommended to us from their own Churches, either by Letters, or by word of mouth, and ſuch are all the members of the Churches in this Countrey,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:199168:41"/>whom wee doe admit to communion with us at the Lords Table.</p>
                  <p>But now for our Brethren, who come out of <hi>England,</hi> many of them are altogether unknowne to us; and thoſe who are well known, (and it may be alſo well approved) yet they bring no Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of recommendations to us from thoſe Churches who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in them, and power over them. And beſides, wee know that thoſe who have been members of any pariſh Church in <hi>England,</hi> when once they remove their dwelling out of that Pariſh, they are accounted as no longer members of that Church; ſo that they come over to us as members of no particular Church at all, either in old <hi>England</hi> or in new; and ſo they are under the power of no Church, either there or here; how then can wee diſpenſe an act of power to them, over whom wee have no power at all, either commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us by themſelves, or by the Churches from whence they came? Would it be thought reaſonable, in caſe that any of our Country-men comming over to us, ſhould fall into drunkenneſſe, or whoredome, or other ſcandalous crimes, if the Church where he ſojourneth amongſt, ſhould proceed to excommunicate him for the ſame? were it not an act, <hi>Coram non judice?</hi> might he not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand juſtly, by what authoritie we caſt him <hi>out of our Communion,</hi> who was never yet <hi>entred into our Communion?</hi> This may therefore yeeld us a juſt defence.</p>
                  <p>They over whom we have no power to cenſure, (in any caſe by Excommunication) to them wee have no power to diſpenſe the Communion; but ſo it is, we have no power to cenſure any of our Congregation (though never ſo ſcandalous) by excommunicating, unleſſe they firſt commend themſelves to our fellowſhip.</p>
                  <p>Therefore neither have wee power till then to receive them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our communion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond ground of their practiſe wee take from the nature of the Sacraments, which though they be ſeales of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.) yet not to all the <hi>faithfull, as ſuch,</hi> but as they are <hi>confederate and joyned together in ſome particular viſible Church.</hi> None may ordinarily diſpenſe a Sacrament of the new Teſtament, but a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of a <hi>viſible Church,</hi> nor may he diſpenſe it to any, but to the members of a viſible Church. In the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, none were partakers, either of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> or of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> unleſſe they were either <hi>Iſraelites</hi> borne, or <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:199168:42"/>
                     <hi>Church of Iſrael. Job</hi> and his three friends, and <hi>Elihu</hi> with them, though all of them righteous by <hi>faith,</hi> and all of the <hi>ſtocke and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Abraham,</hi> yet wee read of none of them to be circumciſed; nor is it credible they were; for had they been <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> they would not have kept ſo deep ſilence of it throughout all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Job,</hi> as they doe; eſpecially having ſo often occaſion to urge the <hi>pollution of nature</hi> from the birth; whereof <hi>Circumciſion</hi> had been a moſt pertinent and pregnant evidence to convince the ſame. And wherefore were they not all <hi>circumciſed,</hi> being all of them righteous by faith, but onely becauſe they had not <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to joyne themſelves to the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> to whom onely the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> unto <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>ſeed,</hi> and the <hi>ſeales</hi> of the Covenant were granted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If it be objected, that all that were <hi>circumciſed</hi> amongſt the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> might come and keepe the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> amongſt them: but wee here withhold the Lords Supper from them that are baptized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our anſwer is, they that were <hi>circumciſed</hi> amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> might rightly keepe the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> amongſt them, becauſe the whole Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made but one Church, and the <hi>Officers</hi> or <hi>Miniſters</hi> of any one <hi>Synagogue</hi> (the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi>) were Miniſters in common to the <hi>whole houſe of Iſrael.</hi> In proportion whereunto they that are baptized in any particular Church, may in like ſort require the Lords Supper in the ſame particular church where they are baptized, if there be no other impediment in regard of their unfitneſſe to <hi>examine themſelves,</hi> which is a thing requiſite to the <hi>receiving of the Lords Supper,</hi> more then was required <hi>to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Paſſeover.</hi> But now becauſe the Churches of the new Teſtament are of <hi>another conſtitution,</hi> none of them <hi>nationall,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, but all of them <hi>congregationall; Baptiſme</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Church doth not give a man right to the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> in <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> unleſſe the Officers of <hi>one</hi> Church were the Officers of <hi>all,</hi> (as in <hi>Iſrael</hi> they were) or unleſſe that one Church and the Officers thereof did <hi>recommend</hi> their <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to another.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third ground of our practiſe in this point is taken from the caſe of <hi>publick offence,</hi> which we conceive ought to be removed from all ſuch as are to partake together at the Lords Table; ſo we deale with the members of our own Church, and ſo wee deale with the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:199168:42"/>members of neighbour Churches in this Countrey: None of them are received unto the Lords Table with us, whileſt they lie under the guilt of any publick ſcandall before the face of the Church: For it is our Saviours direction, that <hi>if a man bring his gift to the Altar, and there remembers that his brother hath ought againſt him, he ſhould there leave his gift, and goe firſt to be reconciled to his brother, and then come and offer his gift,</hi> Mat. 5.23, 24. If this be a rule for a <hi>mans owne private direction,</hi> in caſe of private offences, it will be a rule alſo for a <hi>whole Church</hi> to direct an offending brother to doe the like in caſe of a <hi>publick offence:</hi> Wee doe therefore direct both the brethren of our own Church, and of any other Church in this Countrey, that if they preſent themſelves to communion with us at the Lords Table, they ſhould firſt remove ſuch publick offence, as either <hi>themſelves</hi> or the <hi>Church</hi> from whence they come, doe lie under, before the Lord, and us;<note place="margin">☜</note> that according to the <hi>figure</hi> in the law of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> no <hi>leaven</hi> muſt be found amongſt us when wee come to ſit downe at the Lords Table together.</p>
                  <p>Now though wee rather chooſe to <hi>cover in ſilence,</hi> and to <hi>mourne in ſecret,</hi> for any corruptions found in <hi>other Churches,</hi> eſpecially in theſe ſo deare and neare unto us, as the Churches of <hi>England</hi> be; yet in this caſe, <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> to God and them, and the neceſſary <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> of our own due <hi>proceedings</hi> here, conſtraineth us to confeſſe ſundry publick offences, under which our <hi>Engliſh pariſh Churches</hi> lie, and wherein our <hi>ſelves alſo were defiled,</hi> whileſt we lived in them, and our Country-men are defiled that come over to us from them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a publick offence, that they come over not as members of <hi>any particular viſible Church,</hi> (for they leave that relation where they left their habitation) but of a <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> whereof Chriſt hath given us no patterne in the new Teſtament; and in which he hath appointed no <hi>nationall Churches,</hi> nor any <hi>nationall worſhip</hi> to be performed by them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a publick offence, that though they were <hi>baptized</hi> in ſome pariſh Church in <hi>England,</hi> upon ſome Covenant, or ſtipulation of their parents, or of ſome in their ſtead, whom they call <hi>god-fathers,</hi> which alſo was without warrant, yet generally they have <hi>come to the Lords Table without any publick profeſſion of their own faith, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or promiſe of performance of thoſe Chriſtian duties, which their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:199168:43"/>parents, or others in their ſtead, made for them;</hi> which is an offence, not onely contrary to the order of their owne Church, expreſſed in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the <hi>Common Catechiſme,</hi> but alſo contrary to the word of God, which receiveth none to the fellowſhip of the ſeales of the Covenant, but ſuch as <hi>profeſſe</hi> their <hi>taking hold of the Covenant,</hi> as hath been ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a publick offence, that in their pariſh Communion, (which not <hi>communion of ſpirit,</hi> but <hi>co-habitation</hi> begetteth) they partake with all <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous</hi> perſons, not excluding drunkards, whoremongers, prophane ſwearers, covetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Atheiſts, Papiſts, and the like; whereby it cometh to paſſe, that not a <hi>little leaven,</hi> but a <hi>great maſſe of leaven</hi> hath deeply lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened the whole lump.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a publike offence, that they have worſhipped God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the precepts and inventions of men, both in preſcript formes of Liturgie, and Letanies, and in ſuch ceremonies, as which though they be not <hi>ordained</hi> of God, yet are publickly <hi>enjoyned,</hi> as neither darke, nor dull, but apt to ſtirre up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of dutie to God by ſome notable and ſpeciall ſignification, by which he may be edified.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a publick offence, that they have yeelded voluntary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience to <hi>ſuch a forme of government</hi> in the Church, as the Lord Jeſus hath not appointed in his Word, and have <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> the ſame, whether by <hi>ſubſcription,</hi> or by <hi>oath of Canonicall obedience,</hi> or by <hi>conformitie</hi> to their uſurpations and <hi>injunctions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, or ſuch like publick offences, as wee have <hi>bewailed in our ſelves,</hi> (ſo farre as wee had any fellowſhip with them) ſo wee have thought it needfull, that our brethren alſo who came over to us, ſhould profeſſe their repentance of the ſame, at leaſt in a poſitive acknowledgement, of the contrary ſincere wayes of the Goſpel, before they be received to Communion with us.</p>

                  <p>IF theſe grounds may ſuffice to juſtifie our <hi>non-admittance</hi> of all the Country-men promiſcuouſly, that come over to us <hi>to the fellowſhip of the Lords Table,</hi> without further ſatisfaction, the ſame alſo (or ſome of them at leaſt) may ſuffice to juſtifie our <hi>non-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:199168:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>of their infants unto Baptiſme.</hi> Infants cannot claime right unto Baptiſme, but in the right of one of their parents, or both: where <hi>neither</hi> of the <hi>Parents</hi> can claime right to the Lords Supper, there their <hi>infants</hi> cannot claime right to <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> And they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not claime right to the Lords Supper, if it be ſo that wee have not lawfull libertie to adminiſter the Lords Supper to the Parents, or to one of them at leaſt, either for <hi>our want of due power</hi> over them, or through <hi>their want of Communion</hi> with the Church, (whereof the Sacrament is a ſeale) or by reaſon of ſome <hi>publick offence</hi> which they lie under; (as hath been already opened).

For neither have wee power over them, neither have they communion with any particular Church, being diſmiſſed from the Church where they were baptized, and recommended to none.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this ſundry things are objected, and ſuch (as ſeeme) of much weight; as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> hath been adminiſtred to ſome who were <hi>no members of any viſible Church,</hi> and therefore why not to the <hi>Children of non-members?</hi> as <hi>Philip</hi> baptized the <hi>Eunuch, Acts</hi> 8.37, 38. and <hi>Peter</hi> baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his houſhold, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47, 48. <hi>Paul</hi> baptized <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houſhold, the <hi>Gaoler</hi> and his houſhold, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.33. To which wee anſwer three things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">*</note> Firſt, The Apoſtles had an unlimited power, and might baptize beleevers profeſſing the faith, and their ſeed, whereſoever they came, but the power of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> is limited to their own particular viſible Church, which hath called them to miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">*</note> Secondly, It cannot be proved, that the Apoſtles or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts baptized any but ſuch as either were members of ſome viſible Church before they preached to them, or elſe they gathered them into a viſible Church eſtate, before they baptized them. <note place="margin">*</note> The <hi>Eunuch</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. was a Proſelyte to the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the Text ſaith, <hi>he came up to Hieruſalem for to worſhip,</hi> Acts 8.27. Neither let any man object, that his memberſhip at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to Baptiſme, ſeeing Baptiſme is a Sacrament of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:199168:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church, not of the <hi>Jewiſh;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">*</note> for whatſoever member of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, as beleeved in Chriſt as the Meſſiah, and profeſſed that faith, he was capable of Baptiſme; for ſuch they were whom <hi>John</hi> baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.6. and Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. yea all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were baptized in the cloud and in the Sea, in the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.2. <note place="margin">*</note> As for <hi>Lydia,</hi> and the <hi>Gaoler,</hi> and both their families, they lived together in the ſame Citie of <hi>Philippi,</hi> Act. 16.12. where was a company alſo of other brethren, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and from the beginning of the Goſpel (which doubtleſſe was when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.) he ſpeaketh of them as a Church; <hi>Know yee Philippians</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in the beginning of the Goſpel, no Church communicated with mee, as concerning giving and receiving, but yee onely, Phil.</hi> 4.15. Which evidently holdeth them forth as a Church at that time, and that <hi>Paul</hi> did firſt gather the brethren there into a Church, when he baptized <hi>Lydia,</hi> and the <hi>Gaoler,</hi> and others there. And indeed the Commiſſion which Chriſt gave his Apoſtles, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it forth, that they were by preaching to make Diſciples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they baptized them and their children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. Now a Diſciple (as the meaning of the word implyeth) is a Scholler in Chriſts ſchoole, and therefore when the Apoſtles were directed to make Diſciples before they did baptize them, they were not onely to convert them to the faith, but alſo to gather them as Diſciples or Schollers into a Schoole of Chriſt; and the Schoole of Chriſt is every particular viſible Chriſtian Church, wherein ſome are tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, ſome are Diſciples or Schollers, and his Diſcipline is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt them. Neither is it credible, that the Apoſtles would baptize any, that is, apply to them the ſeale of the Covenant given unto the Church, before they had taught them the Covenant it ſelfe, and entred them into it, in which regard wee cannot eaſily thinke, that when <hi>Peter</hi> baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family, he did onely perceive they had received the holy Ghoſt, and evidently profeſſed the ſame in new tongues, (<hi>Acts</hi> 10.45, 46, 47.) but that he did alſo gather them into one <hi>body,</hi> directing them to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall uſe of the newly received gifts in the Communion of Saints, and baptized them into the fellowſhip of the Lord Jeſus, and of one another in his Name.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Wee anſwer, as the Apoſtles were tranſcendent Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church, ſo they received tranſcendent power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:199168:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>their worke. As the Father ſent Chriſt, ſo Chriſt ſent them, <hi>Job.</hi> 20.21. to wit, <hi>Cum amplitudine &amp; plenitudine poteſtatis,</hi> with all fulneſſe of power, ſo that any <hi>one Apoſtle</hi> received both the <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>all the Officers of the Church. Any Apoſtle</hi> might doe the worke, not onely of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> but of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> of an <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,</hi> of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> of a <hi>Teacher,</hi> of a <hi>Deacon.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 1.1.</note> They doe <hi>foretell</hi> (as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>) things to come, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.22. They travelled up and downe not onely to <hi>plant</hi> Churches, but to <hi>water</hi> Churches, as <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> Acts 15.41. They as <hi>Paſtors feed the flock of Chriſt</hi> with whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words of exhortation,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.25. They as <hi>Teachers</hi> of the Gentiles, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe, taught them in the myſteries of the kingdome of God. They (as <hi>Elders</hi>) <hi>ruled the Church,</hi> not as <hi>Lords,</hi> but as <hi>examples</hi> to the flocke, and as <hi>Deacons</hi> they received the <hi>oblations of the Church,</hi> and diſtributed the ſame according to the neceſſitie of the Saints. Yea,<note place="margin">Acts 4.35.</note> though when the Apoſtles came where Churches were planted, they did put forth no act of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent authoritie, but did all with the conſent of the Church; yet in the abſence of the Churches, they might doe <hi>any act</hi> which <hi>any Church,</hi> and <hi>all the Officers thereof</hi> might doe together. As for ought wee know they might in ſuch a caſe <hi>impoſe hands alone;</hi> ſo <hi>Paul</hi> might ſet apart <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſome ſpeciall office, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. they might alone <hi>deliver unto Satan,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. they alone might <hi>baptize,</hi> in as much as the preſence, and the power, and fellowſhip of any one of them, did comprehend as much as the preſence and power and fellowſhip of the whole Church together; <note place="margin">*</note> their acts therefore in ſuch tranſcendent caſes, are not patterns, nor preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for us; but according to the <hi>meaſure</hi> of the gift of Chriſt, wee are to move in our owne line, and to act onely as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt and his Church, in the <hi>preſence and fellowſhip</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is objected againe, that children of excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch as being caſt out, are not holden as members of the Church, have yet right unto Baptiſme, and therefore it is not well done of us to deny the Baptiſme of the children of ſuch as are not Members.</p>
                  <p>That children of Excommunicated perſons have right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, they prove by ſundry Arguments.</p>
                  <p>1. From the conſideration of the divers ſorts of Members;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:199168:45"/>ſome are members not <hi>actually,</hi> but in the eternall Counſell of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion.</p>
                  <p>2. Some are member onely in <hi>ſhew and appearance,</hi> as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, which are as woodden legs faſtned to the body.</p>
                  <p>3. Some are <hi>lively members,</hi> knit to Chriſt by faith, to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by the ſpirit of love.</p>
                  <p>4. Some are <hi>decayed members,</hi> which though they belong to Gods Election, &amp; are truly ingraffed into Chriſt Jeſus, yet for the preſent have no lively ſenſe of the power and vertue of Chriſt: theſe are like to a legge or arme to a man that hath a dead palſey, which though it remaine for a time without feeling and nouriſhment, yet being joyned to the body, it may be recovered by the vertue of ſome ſtrong medicine, and made whole as the other.</p>
                  <p>Of this ſort are Excommunicated perſons, for in regard of their ingraffing, they are true members, and cannot be quite cut off from the body of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. And though they be holden as cut off from the holy Communion of the faithfull by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cenſure; as alſo becauſe Chriſt ratifieth in heaven, what the Church hath done on earth; and likewiſe becauſe in themſelves they want the free paſſage of the life and vertue of the ſpirit of grace, till they be touched with repentance; yet they are not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off from the ſocietie of the faithfull, becauſe the ſeed of faith remaineth in them, and that knitteth the bond of conjunction with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe godly learned Divines, who doe thus argue, wee doe ſo highly eſteeme, and ſo deeply reverence in the Lord, that were the cauſe our owne, and not the Lords, wee ſhould rather let it fall, then defend it, by oppoſition to the grave judgements of ſuch holy Saints. But becauſe wee may not accept perſons in the things of Chriſt, wee are forced to excuſe our ſelves from ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their judgements in this cauſe, which yet generally in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wee yeeld unto them; Our anſwer therefore is, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch excommunicate perſons as are truly <hi>faithfull</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the cenſure of excommunication) becauſe the ſeed of faith remaineth in them; yet to the <hi>ſocietie</hi> of the <hi>faithfull,</hi> joyned in a <hi>particular viſible Church,</hi> they are not knit, but wholly cut off from their Communion: for it is not the <hi>ſeed</hi> of faith, nor <hi>faith</hi> it ſelfe, that knitteth a man to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that particular viſible Church,</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:199168:45"/>but an holy <hi>profeſſion of the faith,</hi> and profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt in their Communion. Which profeſſion, when a faithfull man hath violated by ſome notorious ſcandalous crime, or by wilfull obſtinacy, in ſtanding out in any offence againſt the rule of the Goſpel, he is now delivered unto Satan, and therefore wholly cut off from the <hi>Communion of the Church,</hi> and conſequently from the <hi>ſeales</hi> thereof: himſelfe from the <hi>Lords table,</hi> his ſeed (which are his members) from <hi>Baptiſme:</hi> he is not now as a dead palſey member, cut off from the body; <hi>Ne pars ſincera trahatur;</hi> the Lord Jeſus may ſtill lay hold upon him by his Spirit, when yet he cannot in any lively manner for the time lay hold upon Chriſt; and ſo he may ſtill remaine a member of the inviſible Church of the firſt-borne, when yet he hath neither part, nor portion, nor fellowſhip in the particular flock and viſible Church of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>but is as an Heathen, or a Publican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the Sacraments are not given to the inviſible Church, nor to the members thereof, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> but to the viſible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches of Chriſt Jeſus, and to the members thereof; ſuch therefore as are cut off from their memberlike Communion with the viſible Church, are cut off alſo from the ſeales of that Communion, Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper. As therefore wee doe not receive an <hi>Heathen</hi> to the fellowſhip of the Supper, nor their ſeed to Baptiſme, ſo neither dare wee receive an <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſon</hi> (who is to us as an Heathen) unto the Lords Supper, nor his children to Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It is objected againe in the behalfe of the children of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate perſons, that it is not in the power of man to cut them off from Chriſt, though they be excommunicate: the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin of the Parent, may not keepe the bleſſing from the childe, and therefore not deprive it of the libertie of the ordinance of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſame power of Chriſt that ratifieth the Cenſure of the Church againſt the Excommunicate parent, though it doe not, cut off the childe <hi>from Chriſt,</hi> (no more then the Father) yet it cuts him off <hi>from the outward fruition of the Covenant</hi> of Chriſt with his Church, and from the <hi>ſeales</hi> thereof: For as Chriſt gave the childe no right unto Baptiſme, but by the Fathers right unto the Coverant, and Communion of the Church; ſo if he taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:199168:46"/>the <hi>Fathers right</hi> from the Covenant and Communion of the Church, he taketh away the <hi>Childrens right</hi> alſo. The perſonall ſinne of the parent is not in this caſe a meer private or perſonall ſinne, but the ſinne of a publick perſon of his family. For as the profeſſion of his faith at his receiving into the Church was as the profeſſion of a publick perſon, for <hi>receiving him</hi> and his <hi>children</hi> (who could make no profeſſion, but by his mouth) <hi>into the Church:</hi> So his violation of his profeſſion by a ſcandalous crime, was as a <hi>publick violation</hi> thereof, for himſelfe and his ſeed, who <hi>ſtand and fall</hi> before the Church in his name and perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It is yet further objected, Wee muſt alwayes put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between perſons Excommunicate, which doe not make ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church, (though they be grievous offenders) and open <hi>Apoſtates</hi> (which joyne themſelves with the enemies of the Church, to the ruine and overthrow of the Goſpel,) and between <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> that are forth of the Covenant, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee willingly put a difference between the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſons and Apoſtates, and Turkes; to wit, in ſuch things wherein they differ. Excommunicate perſons are neerer to helpe and meanes of converſion then Turkes; For Excommunication it ſelfe is a means of ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and Turkes are nearer then Apoſtates; <hi>For better it were never to have knowne the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, then after they have knowne it, to turne away from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement given unto them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.21. But yet in this they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, they are all of them as Heathens, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. And therefore neither the Parents to be admitted to the Lords Table, nor their children to Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Moreover, it is ſtill further objected in behalfe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Command. </seg>2</label> If the <hi>mercy of God enlarge it ſelfe to thouſands,</hi> why ſhould men queſtion whether ſuch Infants belong to the Covenant, and ſo keepe them from the Sacrament of Baptiſme, which is due to them by the right of their Anceſtors?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the <hi>extenſion of Gods mercy to thouſands,</hi> be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to <hi>extend Baptiſme</hi> to the children of Excommunicate perſons, in the right of their Anceſtors; it may ſuffice as well to extend it to the children of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> and ſo the difference of the one from the other (urged in the laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:199168:46"/>will be taken away. For it is not above 66. Generations from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as is plaine in the Genealogie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.23. to 38. and there have not paſſed as many more generations from <hi>Chriſts</hi> time to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> of this preſent age. And then if Gods <hi>mercy to a thouſand Generations</hi> may fetch in the <hi>Children of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate perſons,</hi> the ſame promiſe may fetch in all <hi>Turks and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> at this day; wee dare not therefore improve the large exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods mercy ſo farre as to give a thouſand Generations right and title to the Covenant of God with his Church, and to incourage the Miniſters of the Goſpel to ſet the ſeales of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The true meaning of the promiſe wee take to be, That God out of his abundant grace and rich mercy, may and doth extend thoughts of <hi>redeeming</hi> and <hi>converting</hi> grace and mercy unto thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Generations; But he never allowed his Church any warrant to receive into their <hi>Covenant, and Communion, the Children of godly parents, who lived a thouſand yeare agoe,</hi> much leſſe a <hi>thouſand Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi> Nay rather the Text is plaine, that the holineſſe of the children, dependeth upon the faith of the next immediate parents, (or of one of them at leaſt) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. to wit, ſuch faith as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominateth them <hi>Chriſtian-beleevers,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Pagan Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels:</hi> and that holineſſe of the children to ſuch parents, is called <hi>Federall,</hi> which receiveth them into the Covenant, and to the ſeales of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Laſtly, it is objected, that children borne in <hi>fornication,</hi> have right to Baptiſme, and why not then the children of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate parents? The wickedneſſe of parents ought not to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the children in things that pertaine to their ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The wickedneſſe of the Parent doth not prejudice the <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Redemption,</hi> or the <hi>faith of the childe: Jephta,</hi> a baſtard, is yet reckoned up in the <hi>Catalogue of Beleevers,</hi> Heb. 11.32. But yet in the old Teſtament, a <hi>Baſtard was not admitted to come into the Congregation of the Lord, to his tenth Generation,</hi> Deut. 23.2. and that could not but prejudice all the baſe-borne children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that in the things which pertaine to their ſalvation. And though God ſheweth greater grace to them in the dayes of the Goſpel, yet greater grace cannot (by proportion of any rules of the Goſpel) be expected for them from the Church, then this, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:199168:47"/>the ſinne of their parents, they may be received into the Congregation of the Lord, and ſo unto Baptiſme, either when their <hi>parents repent</hi> and acknowledge their ſin before the Lord and his Church, or when <hi>themſelves are able to make a better profeſſion of better things in their owne perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is generally knowne, that our beſt Divines doe not allow the Baptiſme of <hi>Baſtards, ſine ſponſoribus;</hi> But whether they conſider <hi>Sponſores,</hi> as witneſſes, as ſome doe who fetch allowance of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.2, 3, 4. or whether they conſider them as <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> the holy Scripture gives no warrant for either in ſuch a caſe. The place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> giveth no foothold for Witneſſes in Baptiſme. The Prophet called not <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> for a <hi>witneſſe of the Circumciſion</hi> of his childe; but of the conception of a man-childe yet unbegotten, and of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of ſuch events as were to fall out during the infancy of the childe; nor was it meet the Prophet ſhould honour ſo wicked a <hi>time-ſerver</hi> as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was, to be a witneſſe of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of his childe; though the more prophane and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous he was, the more fit and faithfull a witneſſe of a miraculous prediction, to the <hi>conviction</hi> of an incredulous King, and people: And as for Sureties, the Covenant is not intayled to Sureties, to ſuch as for whom they undertake, but to <hi>faithfull parents,</hi> pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the family of the Church, and to <hi>their ſeed.</hi> It is true indeed, there is a large promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſtretching the Covenant to his ſeed, not onely to the <hi>children</hi> of his <hi>owne body,</hi> and to his <hi>proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte ſervants,</hi> but alſo to all that were <hi>borne in his houſe, or bought with money,</hi> Gen. 17.12, 13. which happily may grant ſo much libertie to a Chriſtian <hi>Sponſor,</hi> that if a ſtranger or wicked man ſhould <hi>give him his childe</hi> from his infancy to be brought up as his owne, it may be <hi>baptized as his owne;</hi> But that is the utmoſt bounds of libertie in this caſe. And very doubtfull it is, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe pertaine onely to the children of <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> either ſtrangers or borne in the houſe. But wee know not any ground at all to allow a faithfull man libertie to entitle another mans childe to Baptiſme, onely upon a pretence of his <hi>owne promiſe to have an eye to his education,</hi> unleſſe the childe be either borne in his houſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him to be brought up as his owne.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE proceed not to Cenſure, but in caſe of <hi>knowne offence,</hi> and ſuch offence as <hi>cannot be healed without Cenſure.</hi> Two ſorts of offences there be, ſome <hi>private</hi> between Brother and Brother; ſome <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,</hi> being knowne to the <hi>whole Church;</hi> or at leaſt to <hi>many.</hi> And of them, ſome are <hi>more groſſe</hi> and hainous, ſome <hi>leſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the offence be private between Brother and Brother, the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offended is to follow the Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. <hi>That is, firſt to goe and tell him of his fault,</hi> or (as the word ſignifieth) <hi>Convince him of his fault, and to admoniſh him of it privately;</hi> So that the plaiſter may be no broader then the ſore; private admonition is moſt ſutable to a private fault, and expreſſeth both the wiſdome and love of the Brother, who in ſo doing, both healeth and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the offence at once: If the offender take the admonition in good part, (as taking part with the admonition againſt his owne ſinne) the Brother hath <hi>wonne and gained him both to God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>repentance;</hi> to <hi>himſelfe</hi> by this <hi>experiment of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love:</hi> But if the offender heare not his Brother, but takes part with his ſinne againſt the admonition, he then taketh one or two more with him, (ſuch as in wiſdome he thinketh to be moſt fit to prevaile with him) that ſo by the <hi>mouth of two or three, his word of admonition may be eſtabliſhed;</hi> or if the offender heare them not, his <hi>word of accuſation to the Church may be eſtabliſhed:</hi> And they coming to the offender and acquaint him with the cauſe of their coming to bring him to the ſight of his ſinne, which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand is committed by him; they firſt call upon the name of Chriſt to be preſent with them in this dutie according to his promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19, 20. where he hath ſaid he will be preſent with <hi>any two or three that are met together in his name,</hi> to aske of him, (for it is upon this occaſion, and this chiefly upon which the promiſe is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:199168:48"/>made.) And the brother offended laieth open the offence before them, and declareth how ill the labour of his love was accepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and deſireth their helpe to aſſiſt him in the conviction of the offender. If they can prevaile with him to acknowledge his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and to be humbled for it, the ſoule of the offender is healed, thanks are given to God, and mutuall love renewed and increaſed amongſt themſelves. But if the offender deny the fact, and there is none to prove it but the Brother that brought them, they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther, becauſe the teſtimony of <hi>one againſt one, will not ſtand in Judgement,</hi> Deut. 19.15. If he acknowledge the fact, but doe not acknowledge the ſinfulneſſe of it, but ſtand ſtifly to juſtifie it, then the Brother firſt offended telleth the Church of it, to wit, in Gods way. He telleth the <hi>Elders,</hi> who are the mouth of the Church, that by them it may be preſented before the Church, and the cauſe heard and examined, and judged by them. Then one of the <hi>Elders,</hi> either by himſelfe, or calling forth the Brother offended, declareth the offence given to him by ſuch a Brother, and what courſe he tooke with him (according to the Rule of Chriſt) to heale his Brother. Firſt by private admonition, but ſo he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not to bring him to a ſight and ſenſe of his ſinne; then how he tooke a Brother or two more to aſſiſt him in the worke, but neither ſo could he or they prevaile with him; which they being preſent, doe openly teſtifie before the Lord and his Church: And <hi>ſo by the mouth of two or three, the word of his accuſation is eſtabliſhed</hi> before the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Church being thus informed of the eſtate and carriage of the offence, the <hi>Elders</hi> doe labour in publick with the offender to convince him, both of his ſinne and impenitencie under it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the faithfulneſſe, and love of his Brethren, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heale his ſpirit in private. It is free alſo for any of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (leave and libertie being firſt deſired and obtained of the <hi>Elders</hi>) to help forward the conviction by any <hi>words of wiſdome</hi> and zeale which God ſhall put into their mouths; wherein if the convictions and perſwaſions of the Church doe prevaile to any kindly humiliation of the offender in the acknowledgement of his ſinne before the Lord and his Church; the <hi>offender is gained,</hi> the <hi>ſinne is ſubdued,</hi> others <hi>diſcouraged from the like offence,</hi> and the <hi>Church is ſatisfied.</hi>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:199168:48"/>
                  <p>But if on the contrary the offender ſtand out in defence of his ſin, as well <hi>againſt the whole Church,</hi> as he did before <hi>againſt the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> who dealt with him in private, the Church then entereth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> of the offence, whether it be groſſe and hainous, ſuch as is condemned by the <hi>light of nature,</hi> (like thoſe caſt out by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.) or whether it be ſuch as (through ſome <hi>miſt of ignorance,</hi> or <hi>ſtrength of preſent paſſion</hi>) he doth not clearly diſcerne the ſinfulneſſe of it: if it be of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort, they proceed then to excommunication, both in reſpect of the <hi>nature of the crime</hi> (whereof more hereafter) as alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his <hi>contumacy</hi> to the Church. If it be of the later ſort, the Church proceedeth not forthwith to excommunication of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, but after once or twice admonition; For in this caſe it is with the <hi>offender</hi> as with an <hi>Heretike,</hi> who may erre at firſt, and ſtand in his error, for want of clear light, and is therefore <hi>once and again</hi> (according to the rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10) <hi>to be admoniſhed before he be rejected:</hi> when therefore an admonition is judged ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, one of the <hi>Elders,</hi> with the conſent of the whole Church, doth <hi>recollect the offence,</hi> and all <hi>the arguments of weight, which have been publikely or privately uſed to convince the offender of his ſinne,</hi> and diſcovereth to him alſo, that <hi>invalidity and ſhallowneſſe of all his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and evaſions;</hi> and thereupon doth <hi>ſolemnly, in the name of the Lord, admoniſh and charge him to ſee the danger of ſuch a ſin, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of his ſoule, in maintaining of it;</hi> that ſo (if it be the will of God) he may be recovered out of the ſnare of the Tempter. Whilſt the Brother is thus <hi>caſt, and lyeth under the cenſure of admonition,</hi> he ſtandeth in the judgement of the whole Church, as <hi>a convinced publike offender;</hi> and therefore, till hee be <hi>reconciled</hi> to the Church by the penitent and publique acknowledgement of his ſin before them, <hi>hee doth abſtain from the Lords Table;</hi> according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Saviour, who <hi>would not have an offender preſent himſelf nor his gift before the altar, whileſt the guilt of the offence of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay upon him,</hi> Mat. 5.23, 24. or, as the <hi>Prieſts in the Law did forbear to eat of the holy bread, whileſt they lay in uncleanneſſe,</hi> Lev. 22.3, 4. or, as one who <hi>lying in his uncleanneſs, did rather pollute the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinance of God by partaking of it, then receive any holineſs from it,</hi> Hag. 2.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>The offender then by this publique admonition being debarred
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:199168:49"/>of his wonted fellowſhip in the Lords Table, and withall being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited, and urged by his brethren and friends, to conſider his great diſtemper of ſpirit, in ſtanding out ſo long in that which is evill; If hereupon (by the grace of Chriſt) he come to himſelfe, and ſee his ſin, and deſire to reconcile himſelf to the Lord, and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, he then acquainting one of the Elders with his deſire, is called forth in the face of the Church, to make publike confeſſion of his ſin, and to judge himſelf for it; wherein, if the Lord help him to hold forth an ingenuous and humble loathing of his ſin and of himſelf for it; they bleſſe God for his bleſſing upon his ordinance, and readily receive him into wonted favour, and brotherly fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, in all the liberties of Gods houſe; but if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the ſpirit of the brother grow more &amp; more hardened in his ſin, and ſtand out againſt all means (publike and private) of his reformation, the Church having waited a convenient time, and yet finding their brother wax worſe and worſe, (as is commonly ſeen in ſuch caſes, wherein men are not humbled under ſuch means) then, according to the rule of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. one of the Elders propounding the caſe, firſt to the whole Church, and they giving their conſents (as before for his admiſſion, ſo now for his expulſion) hee ſetteth his ſin in order again before him, with all the circumſtances and aggravations of it, eſpecially how hee hath taken in vain, and made unprofitable all other means for his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and therefore now, in the name, and with the power of the Lord Jeſus, and with the conſent of the whole Church, he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him unto Satan, as an Heathen or a Publican, for the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the fleſh, that his ſoul may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus; and all this according to the direction of the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5.</p>

                  <p>ANd thus the Church proceedeth, in caſe the offence be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate at firſt, and and leſſe ſcandalous; but if the offence be be publike, and hainous and groſly ſcandalous, ſuch as is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned even amongſt the Heathens, by the light of nature; as thoſe mentioned by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Fornication, Adultery, Inceſt,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:199168:49"/>Murther, Rayling, Extortion,</hi> and the like; or ſuch as are generally accounted damnable and deteſtable amongſt Chriſtians, as <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Blaſphemy, Prophaneneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Wee take our ſelves bound to proceed more roundly againſt ſuch; for in ſuch caſes the Apoſtle doth not direct us to ſuch <hi>graduall proceedings by private admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but if any Brother (ſaith he) be a <hi>fornicator,</hi> or <hi>covetous,</hi> or an <hi>Idolater,</hi> or a <hi>railer,</hi> or a <hi>drunkard,</hi> or an <hi>extortioner, with ſuch a one no not to eat:</hi> For it doth not ſtand with the glory of God, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Church to accept an acknowledgement of ſuch groſſe and ſcandalous crimes without further cenſure; but it becometh the Church, (being a communion of Saints) rather to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the guilt and fellowſhip of ſuch notorious wickedneſs, by expreſſion of their zeal and juſt indignation againſt ſuch ſins by caſting out the committers thereof from fellowſhip amongſt them; for though the blood of Chriſt, and the repentance of an offender do remove any offence, though never ſo hainous in the ſight of God and man, yet God being jealous of his own glory, and of the honour of his Church, is not wont ordinarily to grant repentance unto ſuch notorious ſinners, untill the cenſure of the Church have paſſed upon them.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt the offender lyeth under the cenſure of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though he be excluded from the communion of the Church, and ſo from the Lord Table, and from all other liberties of Church-fellowſhip (as voting in elections, admiſſion of members, cenſures, &amp;c.) yet wee do not debar him from <hi>entrance into the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> of the Church in <hi>time of preaching the Word,</hi> or <hi>Prayer,</hi> or ſuch other worſhip of God, as is not <hi>peculiar to the Church;</hi> for this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty we do not forbid to Heathens and Indians; and perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate are but as <hi>Heathens,</hi> in reſpect of worſhip, although <hi>worſe then Heathens</hi> (even as <hi>Publicans</hi>) in reſpect of familiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate communion; for though wee might eat with an <hi>Heathen,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27.) yet with a <hi>Publican</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> would not eat, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.11. no more may we with <hi>excommunicate perſons,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.

As therefore we do not deny the like liberty, either to <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Negars;</hi> ſo not to excommunicate perſons: Moreover, this further compaſſion and ſuccour wee afford to an excommunicate perſon, that though we have caſt him out of our liberties and priviledges peculiar to Church-fellowſhip, yet wee have not caſt him out alſo of our hearts, nor out of our prayers, nor out of our care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſuch a loſt ſheep into Chriſts fold again; and therefore ſtill, though we forbear all familiar fellowſhip with him, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance towards him, that he may be aſhamed; yet we account him not as an <hi>enemy,</hi> but ſtill take opportunity to admoniſh him as a <hi>Brother,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14, 15. And if we find by the bleſſing of God and Chriſt upon the cenſure, or by the rebukes of many miniſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that the ſoul of the excommunicate perſon be humbled (as it was the caſe of the <hi>inceſtuous Corinthian,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.6.) the Elders diſcovering the ſame, do call him forth before the Church, where he giving glory to God, and confeſſing his ſin, and the juſtice of God againſt him, and holding forth a repenting frame of ſpirit, to the ſatisfaction of the Church, they do with common conſent forgive him and comfort him, and confirme their love to him, by receiving him again into communion with the Church, and into all the liberties of Gods Houſe, as before.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond Reaſon why wee allow ſuch power to the people in Church-cenſures, is taken from the practice of the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> in the caſe of the <hi>inceſtuous perſon,</hi> and that according to the Apoſtles direction; For in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. he directeth the <hi>whole Church of Corinth,</hi> (to whom he writeth) <hi>That they in the name of the Lord Jeſus, when</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yee are gathered together, and my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver ſuch a one unto Satan.</hi> Where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying in the verſe foregoing, that <hi>he had jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged already</hi> that ſo it ſhould be done, doth not argue that now the Church was at hand, he took the <hi>power of judging</hi> the Cauſe <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto himſelfe,</hi> and the publication and declaration of it onely in the Church, but that <hi>he had ſeene already evident cauſe, to judge the partie worthy to be caſt out:</hi> but directed them to doe it with all the power that is requiſite to that action:</p>

When the Excommunicate perſon was humbled under this Cenſure, <hi>Paul</hi> beſeecheth <hi>them</hi> to forgive him, to comfort him, to confirme their love unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8.

                  <p>But that we may more diſtinctly declare our ſelves wherein ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the difference of their mutuall authority, both of the <hi>Church</hi> over the Elders, and the <hi>Elders</hi> over the Church, wee conceive the Church exerciſeth ſeverall acts of authority over their Elders, to wit, in three caſes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In <hi>calling and electing</hi> them to office, and in ordaining them alſo thereunto in defect of their Presbyterie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In <hi>ſending them forth</hi> upon the publike ſervice of Chriſt, as the whole Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſent forth choſen Miniſters with letters of inſtruction to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and other Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.22. Now the Ambaſſador is not greater then he that ſent him, but uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inferiour, <hi>Job.</hi> 13.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In caſe of <hi>offence given by any Elder, or by the whole Elderſhip together,</hi> the Church hath authority to require ſatisfaction of them, and if they do not give due ſatisfaction, to proceed to cenſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the qualitie of the offence. For wee ſee when ſome of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> tooke offence againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and contended with him about it; <hi>Peter</hi> condeſcended to give ample and due account of his actions to the fatisfaction of them all, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.2. to 8.</p>
                  <p>If admonition, and (in ſome caſes) excommunication be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God ſanctified for the healing of the ſoules of Gods people gone aſtray; it were a ſacrilegious injury to the Elders, to deprive them of the benefit of ſuch wholſome medicines, when the eſtate of their ſoules ſhould come to ſtand in need thereof: and it being a ruled caſe, <hi>Cujus eſt inſtituere ejus eſt deſtituere;</hi> If <hi>Plebs obſequens praeceptis Dominicis &amp; ipſa</hi> (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 4.) <hi>maximè poteſtatem habet dignos Sacerdotes eligendi,</hi> then, as hee ſaith there alſo, <hi>poteſtatem etiam babet Sacerdotes indignos recuſandi, &amp; abdicandi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the Elders have rule over the Church, and do expreſſe it in ſundry acts of authority: as,</p>

                  <p>OUr third way of communion with other Churches, is by way of <hi>Conſultation,</hi> whereof wee have given ſome touch before; as 1.

                  <p n="2">2. In the <hi>choice and ordination of Officers,</hi> one Church is wont to ſend to all the reſt about them, for ſuch <hi>Elders,</hi> and Brethren, as may give counſell and direction to their proceedings, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the ſame, as the matter ſhall require; as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly delivered.</p>

                  <p>A Fourth way of our communion with other Churches, is by way of <hi>Congregation,</hi> or gathering together many Churches, or the meſſengers of many Churches to examine and diſcuſſe, either ſome corrupt opinions, or ſuſpicious practices, which being ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and found in many Churches at once, cannot well be healed in any one alone. In which caſe the Elders of the Churches, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to maintain verity, and unity of judgement in matters of doctrine, and integrity of life throughout all the Churches; do both acquaint our <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> being nurſing fathers to the Church, with the neceſſary occaſions and ends of a generall and a ſolemn aſſembly, and do alſo ſolicit the <hi>Churches</hi> to ſend ſome fit perſons, at ſuch a time, to ſuch a Church (where the aſſembly be moſt ſeaſonably held) to conſider and diſcern of the matter in queſtion and agitation.</p>
                  <p>The aſſembly being met in the name of Chriſt, and his preſence called for by humble and earneſt prayer, the matters to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed and cleered, are propounded by ſome or other of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that Church, where we meet, or by ſome other appointed by them, and conſented to by the aſſembly.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:199168:56"/>
                  <p>When the matters are propounded, the Elders do declare their judgements of the points in order, one after another, together with their reaſons from the Word, at which time it is free for any man preſent (and all may be preſent, if they will) as well the Meſſengers of the Churches as others, (after leave orderly craved or obtained) to propound their doubts, without offence) whence diſputation doth ariſe (as in <hi>Act.</hi> 15.7.) till all parties be either ſatisfied or convinced, and ſo the matters in controverſie are cleared; and this courſe is taken for the clearing of all the points remaining, which may ſeem to ſome not ſo fully cleared, and agreed upon, and the nature of them ſuch as may admit further diſcuſſion; yea, and difference of apprehenſion, without diſunion of affection, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the Churches peace; yet for ſatisfaction of Gods people the mean while, in ſuch things each man is left to his Chriſtian liberty: So farre <hi>as they are all come,</hi> they judge and mind <hi>one thing; If any be otherwiſe minded, who in ſimplicity of heart ſeeketh the truth, and in meekneſſe of wiſdome and love holdeth forth the ſame, we hope God will in time reveale the ſame unto him:</hi> in the mean time, all agreeing in this <hi>one,</hi> not to <hi>condemn,</hi> nor to <hi>deſpiſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in differences of weakneſſe, according to the Apoſtles rule,</hi> Rom. 14.2, 3, 4.</p>

                  <head>SECT. V.</head>
                  <p>A Fifth way of communion with other Churches, is by <hi>contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or communication in yeelding ſupply to one anothers wants: for (according to the ancient preſident, in the Primitive Churches) if any of our Brethren ſhould fall into ſuch decay as not to be able to ſupply their onw neceſſities, in outward things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, we ſhould take it our bounden duty, to miniſter to their wants, according to our abilities, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.29, 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.25, 26. Hitherto the Lord hath been pleaſed, out of his all-ſufficient goodneſſe, ſo to ſupply us all, (each Church within it ſelf) as that we have had ſcarce (any occaſion never but once) to exerciſe our mutuall love and liberality to one another in this kind; but if need ſhould require, we conſider afore-hand, what mutuall help God requireth of us from one towards another in ſuch a caſe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, if any of our Churches do want ſome fit members to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:199168:57"/>in ſome publike office amongſt them, and ſhall make known their want to ſome other Church, who may abound in ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, (as ſometimes the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> had four or five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets among them, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1. when others wanted) the Church that aboundeth in ſuch helps, is ready to ſend and commend ſuch of their members as their ſelves may ſpare, and are fit for office, (but not called to office amongſt themſelves) to ſupply the neceſſities of their Brethren.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI.</head>
                  <p>A Sixth way of communion amongſt our Churches, is by way of <hi>admonition:</hi> as it one Church ſhould be credibly given to underſtand, of ſome ſcandall ariſing in another Church, whether by <hi>corruption in doctrine,</hi> or <hi>in manners,</hi> and upon diligent ſearch and inquiry, the report is found true; the Church hearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſendeth Letters, or Meſſengers, or both, unto the Elders of that Church, where ſuch offence is found, and exhorteth them to take a ſpeedy and diligent courſe for the redreſſe thereof; but if the Elders of that Church ſhould be remiſſe therein (or be faulty themſelves) they then certifie the whole Church thereof, to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their officers, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſent to the Church of <hi>Coloſs</hi> to call upon <hi>Archippus,</hi> to take diligent heed to the fullfilling of that work of the Miniſtery, which hee had received of the Lord (<hi>Col.</hi> 4.17.) If the Church heare them, the ſcandall is removed; if it heare them not, the Church offended herewith, taketh in the help of two or three Churches more to joyne with them in their exhortation, or admonition.</p>
                  <p>It ſtill the Church where the offence lieth perſiſteth in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of their duty, and of the counſell of their Brethren; either the matter would be referred to a <hi>Congregation of many, or all the Churches together;</hi> (if need ſhould require) or elſe, if the offence be evident and weighty, and of ill, though not generall conſequence, the Churches offended with them would (as juſtly they might) withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the right hand of fellowſhip, and ſo forbeare all ſuch exercises of mutuall brotherly communion with them, which all the Churches of Chriſt are wont to walke in one towards another.</p>
                  <p>We have never yet been put to the utmoſt extent of this duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:199168:57"/>any of our Churches: The Lord hitherto ſo farre prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his grace, that no Church hath ſtood out ſo long in maintaining any offence found amongſt them: But if it ſhould ſo fall out, (which God forbid) wee look at it as our dutie to be faithfull, one Church to another, in like ſort as the Brethren of the ſame Church are called to be faithfull one towards another; Doe not Churches injoy brotherly Communion one with another, as well as brethren of the ſame Church? The Church in the <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> tooke care, not onely for her own members, but for her little ſiſter, which had no breaſts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8. And would ſhee have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no care of having her breaſts healed, if her breaſts had been diſtempered, and given corrupt milke? The Apoſtles had a publick care (by vertue of their office) of all the Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. And is the publick ſpirit of grace and love dead with them? ought not all the Churches of Chriſt, to have a care and watchfull eye over the publick good of one another? Though not <hi>virtute officii,</hi> yet <hi>intuitu charitatis.</hi>

                  <p>THe ſeventh and laſt way of the Communion of our Churches, is by way of <hi>propagation,</hi> or multiplication of Churches; Though this was a peculiar eminency of the Apoſtolike calling for them in their life-times to travell into all Nations, to preach the Goſpel, to beget Diſciples, to gather them into Church-eſtate, and ſo to plant Churches whereſoever they came: yet that which they did by vertue of their office, is reſerved unto the Churches of Chriſt, to proſecute and carry along (according to their meaſure) throughout all generations, and in all Nations, for the inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the kingdome of Chriſt, unto the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>The power of the keys, which was immediately given by Chriſt unto his Apoſtles, is alſo given by Chriſt unto all the Churches, in that fulneſſe of meaſure, which the eſtabliſhment and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts kingdome doth require.</p>
                  <p>If then any particular Church of Chriſt ſhall come in proceſſe of time to be ſo farre multiplyed, as that like Bees when the hive is too full they are neceſſarily occaſioned to ſwarme forth (as it is indeed the caſe when the voice of their Miniſters cannot reach to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:199168:58"/>all) in ſuch, or in the like caſe, the Church ſurcharged with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, may ſend forth ſundry of their members, fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to enter into a Church-eſtate amongſt themselves; or if a number of godly Chriſtians ſhall come over into a Countrey, where they finde the Churches ſo full, that they cannot with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency joyne with them, the Church may comfortably encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, to enter into holy Covenant amongſt themſelves. They may alſo commend both unto the one Company, and unto the other, ſuch able gifted men, whom they may fitly chooſe, to be Miniſters and Officers to them, and both then when they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant, and gather into Church-eſtate, (as hath been ſhewed in the beginning) as alſo when they goe about to chooſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Church-Officers amongſt themſelves, the Churches already eſtabliſhed ought to be ready to helpe them, with their preſence, counſell, and aſſiſtance, ſo farre as ſhall be found requiſite for the propagation and enlargement of the kingdome of Chriſt, in the multiplication of Churches according to the order of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                  <p>Thus have wee given unto all our holy Brethren, throughout the Churches of our Lord Jeſus, a juſt and true account of all our proceedings in Church-affaires; ſo farre as concerneth our way and order amongſt our ſelves.

                     </gap>, to preſcribe unto our Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> (men of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and eminent lights in the world) what courſe to take in purſuing and perfecting the great worke of Reformation in <hi>England;</hi> Nay, wee know our own <hi>Tenuity,</hi> the ſtore of buſines enough, which wee have to attend unto neere home: Nevertheleſſe, as wee cannot cease to pray for, and ſeek their good as our own; ſo wee cannot but rejoyce with them to behold that open doore which God hath ſet before them, and with that all their hearts were ſo far enlarged towards the Lord, and to his waves, as wee heare his hand is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged towards them. Onely being abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, wee crave leave to beare witneſſe to them, and with them; That if the Lord be pleaſed to proſper his worke amongſt them, it is poſſible to reduce the eſtate of the Congregations in <hi>England,</hi> to ſuch a reformation, as is ſutable to the patterne revealed in the Goſpel, according to the way of Primitive ſimplicitie, deſcribed above.</p>
                  <p>Foure things wee obſerve in the eſtate of the Churches in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which make way for Reformations amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The <hi>efficient</hi> inſtruments of their firſt plantation, which were either <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolicall men,</hi> whether <hi>Philip,</hi> or <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> or <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> as any of our Countrymen may reade in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foxes booke of Acts and Monuments,</hi> in the beginning of it, next after the ſtory of the ten Primitive Perſecutions, out of <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, Tertullian, Origen, Beda, Nicephorus.</hi> Which being ſo, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conceive the Churches in <hi>England</hi> were <hi>rightly gathered,</hi> and planted according to the Rule of the Goſpel; and all the corruptions found in them ſince, have ſprung from Popiſh Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie in ſucceeding ages, and from want of through and perfect purging out of that leaven in the late times of Reformation in the dayes of our Fathers. So that all the worke now is, not to <hi>make
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:199168:59"/>them Churches,</hi> which were none before, but to reduce and reſtore them to their <hi>Primitive Inſtitution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>publick Service-booke</hi> acknowledgeth, <q rend="inline">That in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> there was a godly Diſcipline; That notorious ſinners were put to open penance, and puniſhed in this world; that both their ſoules might be ſaved in the day of the Lord, and others admoniſhed by their example, might be the more afraid to offend. Which godly Diſcipline, is a thing (ſaith the Booke) much to be deſired, that it might be reſtored againe.</q> See the beginning of the <hi>Comminations againſt ſinners.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acknowledged by the very ſtate of the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> that the preſent eſtate of Church diſcipline, is not perfect, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and ſwerving from the <hi>Primitive godly diſcipline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the <hi>publick Rubrick</hi> before the <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> it is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <q rend="inline">That when children come to yeares of diſcretion, and have learned what others promiſed for them in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> they ſhould then themſelves with their own mouth, and with their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, openly before the Church ratifie and confirme the ſame: And alſo promiſe, that by the grace of God, they will evermore endeavour themſelves, faithfully to obſerve and keep ſuch things as by their own mouth and confeſſion they have aſſented to.</q> Which courſe the Booke in a few words after acknowledgeth to be agreeable with the uſage of the Church of times paſt, That chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren coming to perfect age, having been inſtructed in Chriſtian Religion, ſhould openly profeſſe their own faith, and promiſe to be obedient to the will of God. Which direction (if it were as duly obſerved, as it is expreſly ordered) doth plainly hold forth, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as they call it) doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any to be confirmed members of the Church, and ſo unfit to partake of the Lords Supper, till they have expreſly confeſſed their faith openly before the Church, and promiſed obedience to the will of God. Which if it be ſeriouſly done, and not perfunctorily, is ſomewhat of like nature with our receiving of members into the Church, and joyning them by Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In the <hi>Exhortation before the Communion,</hi> the Miniſter is directed to denounce unto the people, <q rend="inline">That if any of them be a blaſphemer of God, an hinderer or ſlanderer of his Word, an adulterer, or be in malice, or envie, or in any other grievous
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:199168:59"/>crime, they ſhould bewaile their ſinnes, and not come to that holy Table, leſt after the taking of that Sacrament, the Devill enter into them, as he entered into <hi>Judas,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Which plainly argueth, they would allow no ſcandalous perſon to partake in the Communion of the Lords Table: All theſe things preſuppoſed, really performed, and ſeriouſly attended to, might open a doore to ſundry paſſages of a more full and perfect Reformation.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Tendering certain Propoſitions tending to the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Churches in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 1. WHere godly Miniſters be already planted in any Congregations, let them (with due encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the State) call the people to ſolemne humiliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord for their own ſins, &amp; thoſe of their fathers they have imitated. So did <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> with the Levites and Prieſts, and upon the like occaſions, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.2.2, 3, 4. &amp; <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.1, 2.9, 10. For though the Parliament, &amp; the whole Kingdome have <hi>proteſted,</hi> and <hi>Covenanted</hi> Reformation for the time to come, yet they have cauſe alſo to be humbled, and that throughly for the time paſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let ſuch of the people, as are of good knowledge in the wayes of God, and of approved converſation, take up that courſe which the Service-book (as hath been ſaid) giveth an hint of; <hi>Renue their Covenant formerly made in Baptiſme, profeſſing their faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and promiſing Reformation of life, not onely in their private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but alſo in their publick Communion in the Church of God, yeelding profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt in the fellowſhip of all his holy Ordinances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let no Miniſter, that loves the Lord Jeſus better then his own belly, ſtand upon his <hi>advocation</hi> from his <hi>Patron,</hi> but rather expect his <hi>vocation from his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. For this end let every Patron reſtore his <hi>jus patronatus</hi> to the Church. Or if it ſeeme too hard a thing for them to part ſo freely with their freehold, (though they ought freely to give unto Chriſt, who have received freely from him) the Parliament may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give them a competent part of the revenues of the Benefice,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:199168:60"/>(as they call it) and annex it to their own private inheritance, reſerving ſo much to the uſe of the Church, as may ſtrengthen their hands in a ſufficient maintenance of their Miniſtery; for though <hi>things dedicated to ſacred uſe, cannot be alienated, or diverted to private uſe without ſacriledge,</hi> yet that holdeth in ſuch things as are ſo dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to ſacred uſe, <hi>as that the Lord accepteth as ſacred to himſelfe:</hi> But God no where in the new Teſtament, hath expreſſed his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, or allowance of lands, dedicated to the miniſtery, but onely to the ſervice of the whole Church, and then for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſervice they may be diſpoſed of by their conſent; as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Kings and Princes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> gave away the treaſures of the Temple, to ſave themſelves from captivitie, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.15, 16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The people having called or choſen their Miniſter (one or more) unto office in a day of humiliation, let them in the preſence of the Miniſters of other Churches depute ſome of the graveſt and godly members of the Church, to lay their hands upon him, with prayer over him in the name of the Lord, ſetting him apart to that office. The whole Congregation are ſaid to <hi>anoint Zadok</hi> to the office of an <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> as well as <hi>Solomon to be King,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.22. Which is a ſacred right, as Impoſition of hands; and this the whole body of them could not doe, but by deputing ſome eminent perſons amongſt them to the performance thereof: But after they be furniſhed with <hi>Elders,</hi> (a <hi>Presbytery</hi> of their owne) let Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands be given by them (according to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.) to ſuch as for the future ſhall be ordained.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For the making up of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Parſon</hi> and <hi>Vicar</hi> (wherewith ſome Congregations are endowed) let them chooſe <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers;</hi> and <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> in ſtead of thoſe who crept into their roome, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Church-wardens,</hi> and <hi>Sideſmen.</hi> But let them chooſe and ordaine them in a day of humiliation (according to <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23.) and not for a yeare onely, but during life; and let the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> of all neighbour Churches, take all opportunities to make uſe one of another, for brotherly conſultation, but not for Juriſdiction, and Authoritie one over another. And in ſtead of <hi>Collectors</hi> or <hi>Overſeers</hi> for the poore (who crept into the roome of <hi>Deacons</hi>) let <hi>Deacons</hi> be choſen as hath been ſhewed above; but not as members of the <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:199168:60"/>
                  <p n="7">7. For ſet forms of prayer, or preſcript Liturgies, let them not be enjoyned unto the Miniſters of the Churches; but let the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as well give up themſelves wholly unto prayer, as to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Word, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Baptiſme may orderly be adminiſtred to the children of ſuch parents, as have profeſſed their faith and repentance before the Church, as above. Or where either of the parents have made ſuch profeſſion; or it may be conſidered alſo whether the children may not be baptized, where either the grand-father or grand-mother have made ſuch profeſſion, and are ſtill living to undertake for the Chriſtian education of the childe; for it may be conceived where there is a ſtipulation of the Covenant on Gods part, and a reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulation on mans part, there may be an obligation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on both parts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. Or if theſe faile, what hindereth, but that if the parents will reſigne their infant to be educated in the houſe of any godly member of the Church, the childe may be lawfully baptized in the right of its houſhold Governour, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the proportion of the law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Let the Lords Supper be adminiſtred onely to ſuch, as have ſo profeſſed their faith and repentance publickly, and are received &amp; approved members of the Church, endued with ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to examine themſelves, and to diſcerne the Lords body: free from ſcandall, and of good converſation.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Let Officers in the Church be redreſſed, and removed, not by preſentments to Officers of other Churches, but according to the order of the Goſpel, deſcribed above, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Where the Miniſters of the Congregation are ignorant or ſcandalous, meet it is that they were removed, and better choſen in their roome by the people; according to the counſell &amp; direction of the godly Miniſters and brethren of neighbour Churches, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Where the people in a Congregation are generally ignorant and profane, it were neceſſary godly Preachers were ſent forth with countenance from the King and State, to preach unto them, till they were brought on to knowledge, and to ſome meaſure of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reformation. Thus <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ſent forth Prieſts and Levites, to teach in the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> and certaine Princes and Nobles with them, to countenance the good worke in their hands, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:199168:61"/>
                  <p n="13">13. Till the people be in ſome ſort duly prepared, and growne up to ſome meaſure of knowledge, and grace, it were neither meet to receive them to a renewing of their Covenant formerly made at their Baptiſme, or to the ſeales of it. But after they have been wrought upon by the Miniſtery of the Word, <hi>to lament after the Lord;</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did when the Arke had been long abſent from them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.29. then let them proceed as other godly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were directed to doe, <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 2, 3, &amp;c. for <hi>renewing</hi> of their <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> for <hi>choice of their Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> and for <hi>Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in all the liberties of the Church of God.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For the helpe of the Univerſities (of the whole Kingdome, and of all the Churches in it) it were neceſſary, that ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced godly learned Nobles and Miniſters were deputed, to viſite and reforme the Univerſities; That ſubſcriptions to Ceremonies and preſcript Liturgies were removed; That degrees in Divinitie were not abuſed unto qualifications for pluralities, and non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, nor allowed in the Miniſters of Churches, to put a difference between brethren of the ſame calling, whence Chriſt hath remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 9, 10. The <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> there mentioned, is not to be tranſlated <hi>Maſter;</hi> for it is a Title common to all Miniſters, but Doctors; and the Academicall title of Doctors, is fitter for Maſters of Colledges, &amp; Readers in the Schooles, then for Church-officers. Here alſo ſpeciall care would be taken for ſetting up of ſuch Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in both the Univerſities, as whoſe ſpirit, and gift, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, might be examplary patterns to young Students.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For the effectuall and orderly expedition and tranſaction of all theſe things, it were requiſite, that as King <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> did, ſo the King and State ſhould depute ſome choice perſons to doe the ſame, to wit, to goe throughout all the Kingdome, to ſee the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple returned, and all the Churches reſtored to a true ſtate and courſe of Reformation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All which things are humbly preſented by us, not as if we would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to give Counſell to them that are wiſer then our ſelves, much leſſe, Injunctions; But as Subjects who deſire to approve our faithfull ſervice to the Lord, and our King and Countrey, hold them forth as true Conſectaries from the Rules of the Goſpel, which ſhould rule us all.</hi>
